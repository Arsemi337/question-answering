# Things to be done

## Common:
- Hyperparameter tuning of extractive qa models

## Extractive qa:
- Evaluation of stride model on medical dataset (smaller text spans)
- How many start_preds before end_preds and how many of these cases can be turned into actual valid predictions using the logits processing

## Generative qa:

## High priority
- Evaluation of stride model on medical dataset (smaller text spans)
- How many start_preds before end_preds and how many of these cases can be turned into actual valid predictions using the logits processing

## Medium priority
- Hyperparameter tuning of extractive qa models

## Low priority
- Train squad_bert-uncased_1 again

## Optional
