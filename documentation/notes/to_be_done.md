# Things to be done

attempt without extract_data step

## High priority
- Evaluation of stride model on medical dataset (smaller text spans)
- Analysis of medical dataset (more)

## Medium priority
- Hyperparameter tuning of extractive qa models

## Low priority
- Train squad_bert-uncased_1 again

## Optional
- Training models with varying stride and comparing their performance
