# Things to be done

## High priority
- Evaluation of stride model on medical dataset (smaller text spans)
- General accuracy and altered test set preprocessing
- How many start_preds before end_preds and how many of these cases can be turned into actual valid predictions using the logits processing

## Medium priority
- Hyperparameter tuning of extractive qa models

## Low priority
- Train squad_bert-uncased_1 again

## Optional
- Training models with varying stride and comparing their performance
