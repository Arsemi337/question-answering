      "Abstract: Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-18. We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B proteins stimulate IL-1β secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein. K(+) efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for SARS-CoV 3a-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results highlight the importance of viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins, in virus-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n",

      "Text: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the genus Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb in length. The 5 two-thirds of the genome encodes large polyprotein precursors, open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF1b, which are proteolytically cleaved to generate 16 non-structural proteins (Tan et al., 2005) . The 3 one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and non-structural proteins, along with a set of accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b) (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Tan et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV is the etiological agent of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . At least 8,098 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection, with a fatality rate of 9.6%, were reported to the World Health Organization from November 2002 to July 2003. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, were detected in autopsy tissues from SARS patients (He et al., 2006) . Although dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in lung injury and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.\n",

      "The innate immune systems utilizes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Medzhitov, 2001; Kawai and Akira, 2010) . Recognition of virus infection plays an important role in limiting virus replication at the early stages of infection. Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including virus infection (Bauernfeind et al., 2011) . Four models describing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been proposed thus far (Hornung and Latz, 2010; Schroder et al., 2010; Tschopp and Schroder, 2010) . First, the disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations, including K + efflux and Ca 2+ influx, play an important role (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2007; Petrilli et al., 2007; Arlehamn et al., 2010; Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2012; Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013) . Second, cathepsin B and L, which are specific lysosomal cysteine proteases, are though to play a role after phagocytosis of cholesterol crystals (Duewell et al., 2010) , fibrillar peptide amyloid-beta , silica crystals, and aluminum salts . Third is the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mitochondrial DNA from damaged mitochondria (Zhou et al., , 2011 Nakahira et al., 2011; Shimada et al., 2012) . Finally, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Upon activation, the NLRP3 is recruited to the mitochondria via association with mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) or mitofusin 2 expressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane Subramanian et al., 2013) ; these molecules then recruit the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. This event activates the downstream molecule, caspase-1, which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms and stimulates their secretion (Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015) .\n",
      "\n",
      "It is increasingly evident that NLRP3 detects RNA viruses by sensing the cellular damage or distress induced by viroporins (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) , transmembrane pore-forming proteins, encoded by certain RNA viruses; these proteins alter membrane permeability to ions by forming membrane channels (Tan et al., 2005; Chen and Ichinohe, 2015) . A recent study shows that the SARS-CoV E protein, which comprise only 76 amino acids, forms Ca 2+ -permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . Although the E and 3a proteins of SARS-CoV, which comprise 274 amino acids and contain three transmembrane domains (Zeng et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006) , are thought to act as Na + /K + and K + channels, respectively (Wilson et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006; Torres et al., 2007; Parthasarathy et al., 2008; Pervushin et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011) , the role of the 3a protein in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we examined the role of the 3a protein in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n",

And the lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes.

The supernatants containing lentiviruses were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter (Millipore) at 72-96 h post-transfection (Ito et al., 2012) .

      "We previously demonstrated that the influenza virus M2 protein (a proton-selective ion channel), its H37G mutant (which has lost its proton selectivity and enables the transport of other cations such as Na + and K + ), and the EMCV 2B protein (a Ca 2+ channel) stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012) . In addition, the SARS-CoV E protein acts as a Ca 2+ -permeable ion channels that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto- Torres et al., 2015) . The fact that 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as viroporin prompted us to examine whether it also triggers inflammasome activation. Thus, we first generated lentivirus plasmids expressing V5-tagged proteins and confirmed their expression in HEK293FT cells by immunoblot analysis (Figures 1A-C) . We next transduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed BMMs with the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E, 3a, M, influenza virus M2, or EMCV 2B proteins. Consistent with previous reports (Ichinohe et al., Figure 1D) . Similarly, the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins stimulated IL-1β release from LPS-primed BMMs ( Figure 1D) . Furthermore, IL-1β secretion from LPSprimed BMMs co-infected with E-and 3a-expressing lentiviruses was significantly higher than that from SARS-CoV E-expressing lentivirus-infected cells ( Figure 1E) . These data indicated that the expression of SARS-CoV viroporin 3a is sufficient to stimulate IL-1β secretion by LPS-primed BMMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous studies demonstrated that the N-terminal 40 amino acids of the SARS-CoV E protein are important for ion channel formation, and that mutations N15A and V25F [located in the transmembrane domain (from amino acid residues 7-38)] prevent ion conductivity (Wilson et al., 2004; Torres et al., 2007; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) . In addition, the SARS-CoV 3a protein contains a cysteine-rich domain (amino acid residues 127-133) that is involved in the formation of a homodimer to generate the ion channel (Lu et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2009) . Thus, mutation of the cysteine-rich domain blocks the ion conductivity by the 3a protein (Chan et al., 2009) . To this end, we substituted amino acids Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133 within the cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV 3a protein with serine to generate a lentivirus expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutant, 3a-CS (Chan et al., 2009;  Figure 2A) . To test whether the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is required to stimulate secretion of IL-1β, we transduced LPSprimed BMMs with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E, V25F, 3a, 3a-CS, or M proteins. Consistent with a previous report (Nieto -Torres et al., 2015) , we found that the V25F mutant lentivirus failed to stimulate IL-1β release from BMMs ( Figure 2B) . Notably, the 3a-CS mutant completely abrogated IL-1β secretion (Figure 2B) , suggesting that the ion channel activity of the 3a protein is required for SARS-CoV 3a-induced IL-1β secretion.\n",

      "FIGURE 4 | NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV 3a.

      "Next, we determined the subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV 3a protein using confocal microscopy. When the SARS-CoV Cell-free supernatants were collected at 24 h (lentiviruses) or 6 h (ATP) post-infection or stimulation, and analyzed for IL-1β by ELISA.

      "3a protein was expressed in HeLa cells, we observed two main distribution patterns. Consistent with previous reports (Yu et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2005) , the 3a protein localized to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 3A ). In addition, the 3a proteins concentrated in spot structures, which mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 3B ). By contrast, the 3a-CS mutant was concentrated in the Golgi apparatus rather than in the ER and did not form spot structures (Figures 3A,B) . We next examined the intracellular localization of NLRP3. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome led to a redistribution from the cytosol to the perinuclear space, a process considered as a hallmark of NLRP3 activation (Zhou et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2013; Moriyama et al., 2016) . Although cells expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutants 3a-CS or V25F uniformly expressed NLRP3 throughout the cytoplasm, it was redistributed to the perinuclear region in SARS-CoV 3a-or E-expressing cells (Figure 4) . Together, these data provide evidence that the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n",

      "Both K + Efflux and ROS Production Are Involved in the IL-1β Release Induced by the SARS-CoV 3a Protein\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we investigated the mechanism by which SARS-CoV 3a triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A previous study showed that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) . In addition, K + efflux is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Mariathasan et al., 2006; Petrilli et al., 2007) . These observations prompted us to examine whether K + efflux is required for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. To this end, BMMs in K + -rich medium were infected with influenza A virus or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins. In agreement with a previous result (Ichinohe et al., 2010) , we found that IL-1β secretion caused by influenza virus was completely blocked when the extracellular K + concentration was increased to 130 mM ( Figure 5A) . The inhibitory effect of the K + -rich medium was also observed when cells were stimulated with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins ( Figure 5B ). Since mitochondrial ROS are important for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Nakahira et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011) , we next stimulated BMMs with extracellular ATP or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins in the presence or absence of the antioxidant, Mito-TEMPO, a scavenger that is specific for mitochondrial ROS Trnka et al., 2009) . As reported previously (Nakahira et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012) , treatment of BMMs with Mito-TEMPO completely blocked IL-1β secretion in response to ATP ( Figure 6A) . Similarly, IL-1β release induced by the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins was significantly inhibited by Mito-TEMPO ( Figure 6B) . These observations indicate that the SARS-CoV 3a protein disrupts intracellular ionic concentrations and causes mitochondrial damages, thereby activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we found that the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, both K + efflux and mitochondrial ROS production are required for SARS-CoV 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far, several models have been proposed to explain NLRP3 inflammasome activation by RNA viruses. First, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Second, viroporins encoded by RNA viruses activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . In the case of influenza virus, the proton-selective M2 ion channel in the acidic trans-Golgi network activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . Interestingly, an M2 mutant in which histidine was substituted with glycine at position 37 (H37G), causing loss of proton selectivity, enables transport of other cations (i.e., Na + and K + ), thereby leading to enhanced secretion of IL-1β from LPS-primed BMMs and dendritic cells when compared with the wild-type M2 protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the 2B proteins of EMCV, poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), and human rhinovirus (a member of the Picornaviridae family) triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing Ca 2+ flux from the ER and Golgi compartments (Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013) . Furthermore, hepatitis C virus stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production though its p7 viroporin (Negash et al., 2013; Farag et al., 2017) . Third, a recent study has demonstrated that the 3D protein of EV71 directly interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome complex (Wang et al., 2017) .\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of SARS-CoV, the viroporin E forms forms Ca 2+permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Yue et al., 2018) . Although alanine substitution at Cys-133, which is required for dimer or tetramer formation (Lu et al., 2006) , still allows activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by interacting with caspase-1 (Yue et al., 2018) , the ion channel activity-loss mutant 3a-CS (Cys-to-Ser substitution at positions Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133) (Chan et al., 2009 ) completely abrogated IL-1β secretion from LPS-primed BMMs, suggesting that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV has the ability to induce the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by multiple mechanisms. Previous studies show that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV is localized to the plasma membrane (Minakshi and Padhan, 2014) and acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) , thereby (presumably) stimulating the K + efflux at the plasma membrane. Indeed, we found that IL-1β secretion caused by the 3a protein was significantly inhibited when the extracellular K + concentration increased to 130 mM. Although it remains unclear whether another viroporin 8a of SARS-CoV (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, these data highlights the importance of viroporins in SARS-CoV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A better understanding of the mechanism that governs the NLRP3 inflammasome will facilitate the development of more effective interventions for the treatment of infectious diseases and increase our understanding of viral pathogenesis.\n",

      "Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-Z) and its spread outside of China, Europe\n",
      "is now experiencing large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented\n",

      "distancing including local and national Iockdowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this report, we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact\n",
      "of these interventions across 11 European countries. Our methods assume that changes in the\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the\n",
      "reproduction number across countries and over time. This allows us to leverage a greater amount of\n",
      "data across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that our results are driven strongly by the\n",
      "data from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain.\n",
      "We find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in Italy is consistent with a significant impact\n",
      "of interventions implemented several weeks earlier. In Italy, we estimate that the effective\n",

      "social distancing (such as banning large gatherings and advising individuals not to socialize outside\n",
      "their households), border closures, school closures, measures to isolate symptomatic individuals and\n",

      "large economic and social costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key aim ofthese interventions is to reduce the effective reproduction number, Rt, ofthe infection,\n",
      "a fundamental epidemiological quantity representing the average number of infections, at time t, per\n",
      "infected case over the course of their infection. Ith is maintained at less than 1, the incidence of new\n",

      "\n",
      "During this early phase of control measures against the novel coronavirus in Europe, we analyze trends\n",
      "in numbers of deaths to assess the extent to which transmission is being reduced. Representing the\n",
      "COVlD-19 infection process using a semi-mechanistic, joint, Bayesian hierarchical model, we can\n",
      "reproduce trends observed in the data on deaths and can forecast accurately over short time horizons.\n",
      "\n",
      "We estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. The high level\n",
      "of under-ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in\n",
      "hospital settings rather than in the community. Despite this, only a small minority of individuals in\n",
      "each country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 4.9% [l.9%-ll%] with considerable\n",
      "variation between countries (Table 1). Our estimates imply that the populations in Europe are not\n",
      "close to herd immunity (\"50-75% if R0 is 2-4). Further, with Rt values dropping substantially, the rate\n",
      "of acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. This implies that the virus will be able to spread\n",
      "rapidly should interventions be lifted. Such estimates of the attack rate to date urgently need to be\n",
      "validated by newly developed antibody tests in representative population surveys, once these become\n",
      "available.\n",
      "\n",
      "We estimate that major non-pharmaceutical interventions have had a substantial impact on the time-\n",
      "varying reproduction numbers in countries where there has been time to observe intervention effects\n",
      "on trends in deaths (Italy, Spain). lfadherence in those countries has changed since that initial period,\n",
      "then our forecast of future deaths will be affected accordingly: increasing adherence over time will\n",
      "have resulted in fewer deaths and decreasing adherence in more deaths. Similarly, our estimates of\n",
      "the impact ofinterventions in other countries should be viewed with caution if the same interventions\n",
      "have achieved different levels of adherence than was initially the case in Italy and Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the implementation of interventions in rapid succession in many countries, there are not\n",
      "enough data to estimate the individual effect size of each intervention, and we discourage attributing\n",
      "\n",
      "associations to individual intervention. In some cases, such as Norway, where all interventions were\n",
      "implemented at once, these individual effects are by definition unidentifiable. Despite this, while\n",
      "individual impacts cannot be determined, their estimated joint impact is strongly empirically justified\n",
      "(see Appendix 8.4 for sensitivity analysis). While the growth in daily deaths has decreased, due to the\n",
      "lag between infections and deaths, continued rises in daily deaths are to be expected for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the impact of interventions, we fit a counterfactual model without the interventions\n",
      "and compare this to the actual model. Consider Italy and the UK - two countries at very different stages\n",
      "in their epidemics. For the UK, where interventions are very recent, much of the intervention strength\n",
      "is borrowed from countries with older epidemics. The results suggest that interventions will have a\n",
      "large impact on infections and deaths despite counts of both rising. For Italy, where far more time has\n",

      "\n",
      "The counterfactual model for Italy suggests that despite mounting pressure on health systems,\n",
      "interventions have averted a health care catastrophe where the number of new deaths would have\n",
      "been 3.7 times higher (38,000 deaths averted) than currently observed. Even in the UK, much earlier\n",
      "in its epidemic, the recent interventions are forecasted to avert 370 total deaths up to 31 of March.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 Conclusion and Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern understanding of infectious disease with a global publicized response has meant that\n",
      "nationwide interventions could be implemented with widespread adherence and support. Given\n",
      "observed infection fatality ratios and the epidemiology of COVlD-19, major non-pharmaceutical\n",
      "interventions have had a substantial impact in reducing transmission in countries with more advanced\n",
      "epidemics. It is too early to be sure whether similar reductions will be seen in countries at earlier\n",
      "stages of their epidemic. While we cannot determine which set of interventions have been most\n",
      "successful, taken together, we can already see changes in the trends of new deaths. When forecasting\n",
      "3 days and looking over the whole epidemic the number of deaths averted is substantial. We note that\n",
      "substantial innovation is taking place, and new more effective interventions or refinements of current\n",
      "interventions, alongside behavioral changes will further contribute to reductions in infections. We\n",
      "cannot say for certain that the current measures have controlled the epidemic in Europe; however, if\n",
      "current trends continue, there is reason for optimism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach is semi-mechanistic. We propose a plausible structure for the infection process and then\n",
      "estimate parameters empirically. However, many parameters had to be given strong prior\n",
      "distributions or had to be fixed. For these assumptions, we have provided relevant citations to\n",
      "previous studies. As more data become available and better estimates arise, we will update these in\n",
      "weekly reports. Our choice of serial interval distribution strongly influences the prior distribution for\n",
      "starting R0. Our infection fatality ratio, and infection-to-onset-to-death distributions strongly\n",
      "influence the rate of death and hence the estimated number of true underlying cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also assume that the effect of interventions is the same in all countries, which may not be fully\n",
      "realistic. This assumption implies that countries with early interventions and more deaths since these\n",
      "interventions (e.g. Italy, Spain) strongly influence estimates of intervention impact in countries at\n",
      "earlier stages of their epidemic with fewer deaths (e.g. Germany, UK).\n",
      "\n",
      "We have tried to create consistent definitions of all interventions and document details of this in\n",
      "Appendix 8.6. However, invariably there will be differences from country to country in the strength of\n",
      "their intervention — for example, most countries have banned gatherings of more than 2 people when\n",
      "implementing a lockdown, whereas in Sweden the government only banned gatherings of more than\n",
      "10 people. These differences can skew impacts in countries with very little data. We believe that our\n",
      "uncertainty to some degree can cover these differences, and as more data become available,\n",
      "coefficients should become more reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite these strong assumptions, there is sufficient signal in the data to estimate changes\n",
      "in R, (see the sensitivity analysis reported in Appendix 8.4.3) and this signal will stand to increase with\n",
      "time. In our Bayesian hierarchical framework, we robustly quantify the uncertainty in our parameter\n",
      "estimates and posterior predictions. This can be seen in the very wide credible intervals in more recent\n",
      "days, where little or no death data are available to inform the estimates. Furthermore, we predict\n",
      "intervention impact at country-level, but different trends may be in place in different parts of each\n",

Meanwhile, on 7 January 2020, the novel coronavirus, currently named 2019-nCoV, was officially announced as the causative agent by Chinese authorities [3] . In order to support public health action, viral genome sequences were released by Chinese researchers on 10 January [4] and 2 days later, four further sequences were also made available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/). While more cases are being reported on a daily basis and there is evidence for some human-to-human transmission in China, a number of important questions remain unanswered. For example, there is no certainty about the source of the outbreak, the transmissibility of the virus as well as the clinical picture and severity of the disease.\n",

Before this publication, a description of the assays had already been made publically available on a dedicated WHO webpage [6] to support rapid development of laboratory testing capacities. The other is a rapid communication where researchers based in Hong Kong report on their attempt to estimate the severity among hospitalised cases of 2019-nCoV infection through modelling based on publically available information, mainly from Wuhan health authorities [7] .

      "Abstract: The first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), associated with infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV), occurred in 2012 in Jordan but were reported retrospectively. The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been found in a bat and in many dromedary camels (DC). MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with approximately 20 % of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the emergence of MERS. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the past three years, understanding of the interplay between camel, environment, and human remains limited. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12985-015-0439-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: An email from Dr Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian virologist working at the Dr Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) announced the first culture of a new coronavirus to the world. The email was published on the website of the professional emerging diseases (ProMED) network on 20 th September 2012 [1] (Fig. 1) and described the first reported case, a 60 year old man from Bisha in the KSA. This information led to the rapid discovery of a second case of the virus, this time in an ill patient in the United Kingdom, who had been transferred from Qatar for care [2] . The new virus was initially called novel coronavirus (nCoV) and subsequentlty entitled the Middle East respiratoy syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). As of 2 nd of September 2015, there have been 1,493 detections of viral RNA or virus-specific antibodies across 26 countries (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ) confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with over a third of the positive people dying (at least 527, 35 %) [3] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Since that first report, a slow discovery process over the following two to three years revealed a virus that had infected over 90 % of adult dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) in the KSA [4] , also DCs across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa that are a source of DC imports for the KSA [5] . To date, MERS-CoV has not been detected in DCs tested in zoos or herds from other parts of the world [6] [7] [8] [9] . Occasionally, virus is transmitted from infected DCs to exposed humans. Subsequent transmission to other humans requires relatively close and prolonged exposure [10] .\n",
      "\n",
      "The first viral isolate was patented and concerns were raised that this would restrict access to both the virus and to viral diagnostics [11, 12] . However, sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics were quickly described and virus was made freely available subject to routine biosafety considerations [13] . Subsequent epidemiology and research has identified the cell receptor as exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26); that MERS-CoV has a broad tropism, replicating better in some cells lines and eliciting a more proinflammatory response than SARS-CoV; is widespread in DCs; has the potential to infect other animals and that MERS kills its human host more often than SARS did (20-40 % versus 9 % for SARS [14] ) [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .\n",
      "\n",
      "In humans, overt disease was given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome, with the acronym MERS. From intermittent animal-to-human spill-over events, the MERS-CoV spreads sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older adults, especially males, with pre-existing diseases. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, with around 20 % of all cases to date involving healthcare workers (HCWs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although DCs appear to suffer the equivalent of a 'common cold' from MERS-CoV infection, in humans, the virus can be a more serious and opportunistic pathogen associated with the death of up to 40 % of reported cases. It has yet to be established whether infections thought to have been acquired from an animal source produce a more severe outcome than those spread between humans [20] . Studies have established that the mean incubation period for MERS is five to six days, ranging from two to 16 days, with 13 to 14 days between when illness begins in one person and subsequently spreads to another [21] [22] [23] [24] . Among those with progressive illness, the median time to death is 11 to 13 days, ranging from five to 27 days [23, 24] . Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline, only to be followed by a more severe systemic and respiratory syndrome [25, 26] .\n",
      "\n",
      "The first WHO case definition [27] defined probable cases of MERS based on the presence of febrile illness, cough and requirement for hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract (LRT) involvement. It also included roles for contact with a probable or confirmed case or for travel or residence within the Arabian Peninsula. If strictly adhered to, only the severe syndrome would be subject to laboratory testing, which was the paradigm early on [21] . From July 2013, the revised WHO case definition included the importance of seeking out and understanding the role of asymptomatic cases and from June 2014, the WHO definition more clearly stated that a confirmed case included any person whose sample was RT-PCR positive for MERS-CoV, or who produced a seroconversion, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. [28] [29] [30] Apart from the WHO and the KSA Ministry of Health reports, asymptomatic or subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection were documented in the scientific literature although not always as often as occurred early on [31, 32] . The KSA definition of a case became more strict on 13 th May 2014, relying on the presence of both clinical features and laboratory confirmation [33] . Testing of asymptomatic people was recommended against from December 2014 [34] , reinforced by a case definition released by the KSA Ministry of Health in June 2015 [35] . The KSA has been the source of 79 % of human cases. Severe MERS is notable for its impact among older men with comorbid diseases including diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis and various lung, renal and cardiac conditions [36] [37] [38] . Interestingly in June 2015, an outbreak in South Korea followed a similar distribution [39, 40] . Among laboratory confirmed cases, fever, cough and upper respiratory tract (URT) signs and symptoms usually occur first, followed within a week by progressive LRT distress and lymphopaenia [37] . Patients often present to a hospital with pneumonia, or worse, and secondary bacterial infections have been reported [37, 41] . Disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure [37] . MERS has reportedly killed approximately 35 % of all reported cases, 42 % of cases in the KSA, yet only 19 % of cases in South Korea, where mortality ranged from 7 % among younger age groups to 40 % among those aged 60 years and above [42] ; all may be inflated values with asymptomatic or mild infections sometimes not sought or not reported [34] . General supportive care is key to managing severe cases [43] . Children under the age of 14 years are rarely reported to be positive for MERS-CoV, comprising only 1.1 % (n = 16) of total reported cases. Between 1 st September 2012 and 2 nd December 2013, a study described the then tally of paediatric cases in the KSA, which stood at 11 (two to 16 years of age; median 13 years); nine were asymptomatic (72 %) and one infant died [44] . In Amman, Jordan, 1,005 samples from hospitalized children under the age of two years with fever and/or respiratory signs and symptoms were tested but none were positive for MERS-CoV RNA, despite being collected at a similar time to the first known outbreak of MERS-CoV in the neighbouring town of Al-Zarqa [45] . A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother did subsequently develop antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection [46] . Her exposure history to a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive relative and an antibody-reactive husband, her incubation period and her symptom history met the WHO criteria for being a probable MERS-CoV case [46] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnostic methods were published within days of the ProMED email announcing the first MERS case [47] , including several now gold standard in-house RT-rtPCR assays (Fig. 2 ) as well as virus culture in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells [18, 47, 48] . A colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) epithelial cell line has since been recommended for isolation of infections MERS-CoV [49] . We previously [18] .). Open reading frames are indicated as yellow rectangles bracketed by terminal untranslated regions (UTR; grey rectangles). FS-frame-shift. Predicted regions encompassing recombination break-points are indicated by orange pills. Created using Geneious v8.1 [211] and annotated using Adobe Illustrator. Beneath this is a schematic depicting the location of RT-PCR primers (blue arrows indicate direction) and oligoprobes (green rectangles) used in the earliest RT-rtPCR screening assays and conventional, semi-nested (three primers) RT-PCR confirmatory sequencing assays [47, 48] . Publication order is noted by first [27 th September 2012; red] and second [6 th December 2012; orange] coloured rectangles; both from Corman et al. [47, 48] Those assays recommended by the WHO are highlighted underneath by yellow dots [53] . The NSeq reverse primer has consistently contained one sequence mismatch with some MERS-CoV variants. An altered version of that from Mackay IM, Arden KE. Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd. Virus Res 2015 Vol 202:60-88 with permission from Elsevier [5] reviewed the broad tropism of MERS-CoV [5] . However, as is well described, cell culture is a slow, specialised and insensitive method [50] while PCR-based techniques are the preferred method for MERS-CoV detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b; Fig. 2 ) have become a key diagnostic and taxonomic target for CoV species identification. With less than 80 % identity between the amino acid sequence of MERS ORF 1ab and betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, it can be concluded that it is a novel and distinct virus. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode ten open reading frames with 5' and 3' untranslated regions [51] . The structural proteins include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [52] . The products of ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode nonstructural proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of specimen testing to date has employed validated RT-rtPCR assays shown to be sensitive and specific [47, 48, 53] . The RealStar® kit uses these WHOrecommended assays [54] . The target sequences of these screening assays have not changed among genomes examined until at least mid-2015 (IMM observation). Other RT-rtPCR assays have been developed and validated for use as laboratory-based diagnostic tools [55] [56] [57] . Additionally, loop-mediated [58, 59] or recombinase polymerase [60] isothermal assays have been designed for field deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The detection of MERS-CoV antigen has not been common to date but the combination of short turnaround time from test to result, high throughput and identification of viral proteins makes this an attractive option. Detection of viral proteins rather than viral RNA indicates the likely presence of infectious virus. The first rapid immunochromatographic tool described could detect recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein from DC nasal swabs with 94 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity compared to RT-rtPCR [61] . A different approach used a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein with a sensitivity of 10 3 TCID 50 and 100 % specificity [62] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Demonstration of a seroconversion to a MERS-CoV infection meets the current WHO definition of a case so optimized and thoroughly validated sero-assays employed alongside good clinical histories are useful to both identify prior MERS-CoV infection and help support transmission studies. Because serology testing is, by its nature, retrospective, it is usual to detect a viral footprint, in the form of antibodies, in the absence of any signs or symptoms of disease and often in the absence of any viral RNA [63] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategic, widespread sero-surveys of humans using samples collected after 2012 are infrequent. Much of the Arabian Peninsula and all of the Horn of Africa lack baseline data describing the proportion of the community who may have been infected by a MERS-CoV. However, sero-surveys have had widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a transmission source for MERS-CoV. Because of the identity shared between DC and human MERS-CoV (see Molecular epidemiology: using genomes to understand outbreaks), serological assays for DC sero-surveys should be transferrable to human screening with minimal re-configuration. Also, no diagnostically relevant variation in neutralization activity have been found from among a range of circulating tested MERS-CoV isolates and sera, so whole virus or specific protein-based sero-assays should perform equivalently in detecting serological responses to the single MERS-CoV serotype [49] . The development of robust serological assays requires reliable panels of wellcharacterized animal or human sera, including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to likely sources of cross-reaction [64] . Obtaining these materials was problematic and slowed the development and commercialization of antibody detection assays for human testing [64] . A number of commercial ELISA kits, immunofluorescent assays (IFA) kits, recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies have been released [31, [65] [66] [67] [68] . Initially, conventional IFAs were used for human sero-surveys. These relied on MERS-CoV-infected cell culture as an antigen source, detecting the presence of human anti-MERS-CoV IgG, IgM or neutralizing antibodies in human samples [18, 48, 69] . No sign of MERS-CoV antibodies was found among 2,400 sera from patients visiting Hospital in Jeddah, from 2010 through 2012, prior to the description of MERS-CoV [18] . Nor did IFA methods detect any sign of prior MERS-CoV infection among a small sample of 130 healthy blood donors from another Hospital in Jeddah (collected between Jan and Dec 2012) [70] . Of 226 slaughterhouse workers, only eight (3.5 %) were positive by IFA, and those sera could not be confirmed by virus neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of crossreactive antigen in the whole virus IFA [70] . Whole virus MERS-CoV IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera and this could not be resolved by an NT test which was also cross-reactive [71] . IFA using recombinant proteins instead of whole-virus IFA, has been shown to be a more specific tool [31] . Since asymptomatic zoonoses have been posited [72] , an absence of antibodies to MERS-CoV among some humans who have regular and close contact with camels may reflect the rarity of actively infected animals at butcheries, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs [70] , a pre-existing cross-protective immune status or some other factor(s) resulting in a low risk of disease and concurrent seroconversion developing after exposure in this group. IFA using recombinant proteins instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some sero-assays have bypassed the risks of working with infectious virus by creating transfected cells expressing recombinant portions of the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid and spike proteins [48, 73] , or using a recombinant lentivirus expressing MERS-CoV spike protein and luciferase [74, 75] . A pseudo particle neutralization (ppNT) assay has seen widespread used in animal studies and was at least as sensitive as the traditional microneutralization (MNT) test. [10, 74, [76] [77] [78] ] Studies using small sample numbers and ppNT found no evidence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody in sera from 158 children with LRT infections between May 2010 and May 2011, 110 sera from 19 to 52 year old male blood donors and 300 selfidentified animal workers from the Jazan Region of the KSA during 2012 [79, 80] . Similarly, a study of four herdsmen in contact with an infected DC herd in Al-Ahsa, eight people who had intermittent contact with the herd, 30 veterinary surgeons and support staff who were not exposed to the herd, three unprotected abattoir workers in Al-Ahsa and 146 controls who were not exposed to DCs in any professional role, found none with serological evidence of past MERS-CoV infection using the ppNT assay [10] . A delay in the neutralizing antibody response to MERS-CoV infection was associated with increased disease severity in South Korea cases with most responses detectable by week three of illness while others, even though disease was severe, did not respond for four or more weeks [81] . The implications for our ability to detect any response in mild or asymptomatic cases was not explored but may be a signifcant factor in understanding exposure in the wider community.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Jordanian outbreak of acute LRT disease in a hospital in 2012 was retrospectively found to be associated with MERS-CoV infection, initially using RT-rtPCR, but subsequently, and on a larger scale, through positivity by ELISA and IFA or MNT test. [46, 82, 83] This outbreak predated the first case of MERS in the KSA. The ELISA used a recombinant nucleocapsid protein from the group 2 betacoronavirus bat-CoV HKU5 to identify antibodies against the equivalent crossreactive MERS-CoV protein [71] . It was validated using 545 sera collected from people with prior HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HRV, HMPV or influenza A(H1N1) infections but was reportedly less specific than the recombinant IFA discussed above. It was still considered an applicable tool for screening large sample numbers [82] . A protein microarray expressing the S1 protein subunit has also been validated and widely used for DC testing [5, 84] . Detection of MERS-CoV infection using ELISA or S1 subunit protein microarray [84] is usually followed by confirmatory IFA and/ or a plaque-reduction neutralization (PRNT) [69, 70, 85] or MNT test. [74, 85, 86] This confirmatory process aims toensure the antibodies detected are able to specifically neutralize the intended virus and are not more broadly reactive to other coronaviruses found in DCs (bovine CoV, BCoV) or humans (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV). In the largest study of human sera, a tiered diagnostic process assigned both recombinant IFA and recombinant ELISA positive sera to 'stage 1' seropositivity. A stage 2 seropositive result additionally required a suitably titred PRNT result [87] . The study found 15 sera collected in 2012 to 2013 from 10,009 (0.2 %) people in 13 KSA provinces contained MERS-CoV antibodies, but significantly higher proportions in occurred in camel shepherds (two of 87; 2.3 %) and slaughterhouse workers (five of 140; 3.6 %) [87] . Contemporary surveys are needed.\n",

      "MERS-CoV does not appear to be easily transmitted from DCs to humans, or perhaps it is [72] , but generally does not trigger a detectable immune response if only mild disease or asymptomatic infection results. Serology assays are in need of further validation in this area so care is required when moving newly developed diagnostic serology algorithms from a research setting to one that informs public health decisions. This was reinforced when a false positive US case, purported to have been infected after a handshake and two face-to-face meetings, did not withstand further confirmatory analysis using a more specific, NT assay and was subsequently retracted [88, 89] .\n",

      "The WHO recommends sampling from the LRT for MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR testing, especially when sample collection is delayed by a week or more after onset of symptoms. [53] LRT samples are also best for attempting isolation of infectious virus, although the success of culture is reduced when disease persists [49] . Recommended sample types include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal/tracheobronchial aspirate, pleural fluid and sputum [53, 90] . Fresh samples yield better diagnostic results than refrigerated material [69] and if delays in testing of ≥72 h are likely, samples (except for blood) should be frozen at −70°C [90] . If available, lung biopsy or autopsy tissues can also be tested [53] . The URT is a less invasive and more convenient sampling site however, and an oropharyngeal and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash are recommended when URT sampling is to be conducted [90] . Paired sera, collected two to three weeks apart are preferable for serological testing while a single sample is suggested to be sufficient if collected two weeks after onset of disease or a single serum collected during the first 10-12 days if conducting RT-rtPCR [53, 90] . Human urine and stool have been found to contain MERS-CoV RNA 12 to 26 days after symptom onset [25, 69, 91] and are listed as samples that should be considered [53, 90] . In two cases that arrived in the Netherlands, urine was RT-rtPCR negative but faeces was weakly positive and sera were RT-rtPCR positive for five days or more [25] . The finding of MERS-CoV viral RNA in serum provides an avenue for retrospective PCR-based studies if respiratory samples are unavailable [83] . RNAaemia may also correlate with disease severity; signs of virus were cleared from the serum of a recovered patient, yet lingered until the death of another [92] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinically suspected MERS cases may return negative results by RT-rtPCR. Data have shown one or more negative URT samples may be contradicted by further URT sampling or the use of LRT samples, which is preferred [2, 43, 93] . Higher viral loads occur in the LRT compared to the URT. [22, 69, 88, 94] This fits with the observation that the majority of disease symptoms are reported to manifest as systemic and LRT disease [21] . However, on occasion, even LRT specimens from MERS cases may initially be negative, only to later become positive by RT-PCR [95] . This may be due to poor sampling when a cough is absent or non-productive or because the viral load is low [95] . Despite this both the largest human MERS-CoV studies [32, [96] [97] [98] and smaller ones [22, 25, 99] , use samples from the URT. It is then noteworthy that one study reported an association between higher loads in the URT and worse clinical outcome including intensive care and death [94] . At writing, no human data exist to define whether the virus replicates solely or preferentially in the LRT or URT, or replicates in other human tissues in vivo although MERS-CoV RNA has been detected from both the URT and LRT in a macaque monkey model [100] .The distribution of DPP4 in the human upper airways is also not well described.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individual human case studies report long periods of viral shedding, sometimes intermittently and not necessarily linked to the presence of disease symptoms. [25, 69, 99, 101] In one instance, a HCW shed viral RNA for 42 days in the absence of disease [99] . It is an area of high priority to better understand whether such cases are able to infect others. Over three quarters of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their LRT specimens (tracheal aspirates and sputum) for at least 30 days, while only 30 % of contacts were still shedding RNA in their URT specimens [91, 102] .\n",
      "\n",
      "In the only study to examine the effect of sample type on molecular analysis, 64 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA; an URT sample), 30 tracheal aspirates, 13 sputa and three BAL were examined. The tracheal aspirates and BAL returned the highest viral load values followed by NPA and sputum. Unsurprisingly, higher viral loads generally paralleled whole genome sequencing and culture success and, in NPA testing, were significantly correlated with severe disease and death [49, 94, 103] . This study demonstrated the importance of LRT sampling for whole genome sequencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When tested, samples positive for MERS-CoV are often negative for other pathogens [2, 25, 93, 104] . However, many studies make no mention of additional testing for endemic human respiratory viruses [21, 23, 73, 105] . When viruses are sought, they have included human herpesvirus (HHV), rhinoviruses (HRV), enteroviruses (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs),influenzaviruses (IFVs), endemic HCoVs, adenoviruses (AdVs) metapneumovirus (MPV) and influenza A\\H1N1 virus; co-detections with MERS-CoV have been found on occasion [2, 22, 37, 69, 97] . Bacterial testing is sometimes included (for example, for Legionella and Pneumococcus) but the impact of bacterial co-presence is also unclear [22, [104] [105] [106] . Further testing of the LRT sample from the first MERS case used IFA to screen for some viruses (negative for IFV, PIVs, RSV and AdVs) and RT-PCR for others (negative for AdV, EVs, MPV and HHVs) [18] . RT-PCR also detected MERS-CoV. The WHO strongly recommends testing for other respiratory pathogens [53] but with this recommendation often discounted, there are limited data to address the occurrence and impact of co-infections or alternative viral diagnoses among both MERS cases and their contacts. Little is known of other causes of MERS-like pneumonia in the KSA or of the general burden of disease due to the known classical respiratory viruses.\n",

      "Testing of adult pilgrims performing the Hajj in 2012 to 2014 has not detected any MERS-CoV. In 2012, nasal swabs from 154 pilgrims collected prior to leaving for or departing from the KSA were tested [47] . In 2013, testing was significantly scaled up with 5,235 nasopharyngeal swabs from 3,210 incoming pilgrims and 2,025 swabs from outgoing pilgrims tested [98] . It should be noted that most pilgrims arrived from MERS-free countries. A further 114 swabs were taken from pilgrims with influenza-like illness [96, 107] . In earlier Hajj gatherings, it was found that influenza viruses circulated widely, whilst other viruses, often rhinoviruses, circulated more selectively, interpreted as indicating their importation along with foreign pilgrims. [107] [108] [109] Over time, increased influenza vaccination has been credited for a fall in the prevalence of influenza like illnesses among Hajj pilgrims. [110] A LRT sample is often not collected for these studies [98, 107, 109] , so false negative findings are a possibility although little is known about the initial site of MERS-CoV infection and replication; it may have been assumed it was the LRT because disease was first noticed there but the URT may be the site of the earliest replication.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Jeddah between March and July 2014 (hereafter called the Jeddah-2014 outbreak; Fig. 3 ), there was a rapid increase in MERS cases, accompanied by intense screening; approximately 5,000 samples from in and around the region were tested in a month yielding around 140 MERS-CoV detections (~3 % prevalence) [111] . Among 5,065 individuals sampled and tested across the KSA between October 2012 and September 2013,108 (2.1 %) detections were made in a hospital-centric population which included hospitalized cases (n = 2,908; 57.4 %), their families (n = 462; 9.1 %) and associated HCWs (n = 1,695; 33.5 %) [32] . Among the detections, 19 (17.8 %) were HCWs and 10 (9.3 %) were family contacts [32] .\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2-3 % prevalence of active MERS-CoV infections is not dissimilar to the hospital-based prevalence of other human CoVs. [112] However, the proportion of deaths among those infected with MERS-CoV is much higher than that known for the HCoVs NL63, HKU1, 229E or OC43 in other countries, and even above that for SARS-CoV; it is not a virus that could reasonably be described as a \"storm in a teacup\". It is the low transmission rate that has prevented worldwide spread, despite many \"opportunities\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Very early in the MERS outbreak, some animals were highly regarded as either the reservoir or intermediate host(s) of MERS-CoV with three of the first five cases having contact with DCs [73, 113, 114] . Today, animal MERS-CoV infections must be reported to the world organization for animal health as an emerging disease [115] . A summary of the first MERS cases reported by the WHO defined animal contact with humans as being direct and within 10 days prior to symptom onset [20] . This definition made no specific allowance for acquisition from DCs through a droplet-based route, which is very likely route for acquisition of a virus that initially and predominantly causes respiratory disease [23] . Camels are known to produce high levels of MERS-CoV RNA in their URT and lungs [116] . Providing support for a droplet transmission route and perhaps indicating the presence of RNA in smaller, drier droplet nuclei, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in a high volume air sample collected from a barn housing an infected DC [117] . The precise source from which humans acquire MERS-CoV remains poorly studied but it seems likely that animal and human behavioural factors may play roles (Fig. 3) [118] . These factors may prove important for human cases who do not describe any DC contact [119] nor any contact with a confirmed case. Whether the WHO definition of animal contact is sufficient to identify exposure to this respiratory virus remains unclear. Wording focuses on consumption of DC products but does not specifically ascribe risk to a droplet route for acquisition of MERS-CoV from DC [120] . Some MERS patients are listed in WHO disease notices as being in proximity to DCs or farms, but the individuals have not described coming into contact with the animals. No alternative path for acquiring infection is reported in many of these instances. What constitutes a definition of \"contact\" during these interviews has been defined for one study [72] . Despite this lack of clarity, the WHO consider that evidence linking MERS-CoV transmission between DCs to humans is irrefutable (Fig. 4) [120] .\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility that bats were an animal host of MERS-CoV was initially widely discussed because of the existing diversity of coronaviruses known to reside among them [121] [122] [123] [124] . Conclusive evidence supporting bats as a source for human infections by MERS-CoV has yet to be found, but bats do appear to host ancestral representatives [53, 125] . However, these are not variants of the same virus nor always within the same phylogenetic lineage as MERS-CoV; they are each a genetically distinct virus. Bat-to-human infection by MERS-CoV is a purely speculative event. The only piece of MERS-CoV-specific evidence pointing to bats originates from amplification of a 190 nt fragment of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase gene of the MERS-CoV genome, identified in a faecal pellet from an insectivorous Emballonuridae bat, Taphozous perforatus found in Bisha, the KSA [121] . While very short, the sequence of the fragment defined it as a diagnostic discovery. Subsequently a link to DCs was reported [85] and that link has matured into a verified association [38, 126] (Fig. 4) .\n",

Middle East respiratory syndrome: An emerging coronavirus infection tracked by the crowd. Virus Res 2015 Vol 202:60-88 with permission from Elsevier [5] DCs, which make up 95 % of all camels, have a central presence in the Arabian Peninsula where human-DC contact ranges from little to close [119] . Contact may be commonplace and could occur in variety of ways (Fig. 4a) . There are several large well-attended festivals, races, sales and parades which feature DCs and DCs are also kept and bred close to populated areas in the KSA [127, 128] . DC milk and meat are widely consumed and the older DC is an animal of ritual significance after the Hajj pilgrimage [129] . However, MERS-CoV infection frequency is reportedly much lower than is the widespread and frequent habit of eating, drinking and preparing DC products. Daily ingestion of fresh unpasteurized DC milk is common among the desert Bedouin and many others in the KSA. DC urine is also consumed or used for supposed health benefits. Despite camel butchery being a local occupation, neither butchers nor other at-risk groups are identifiable among MERS cases; this may simply be a reporting issue rather than an unexplainable absence of MERS. A small case-control study published in 2015 identified direct DC contact, and not ingestion of products, to be associated with onset of MERS [38] .\n",

      "The first sero-survey of livestock living in the Middle East region was conducted during 2012-2013 [85] . DCs were sampled from a mostly Canary Island-born herd and from Omani DCs (originally imported from the Horn of Africa) [85] . A neutralising antibody assay found only 10 % of strongly seropositive Canary Island [5] . b Camel-to-human infections appear to be infrequent, while human-to-human spread of infection is regularly facilitated by poor IPC in healthcare settings where transmission is amplified, accounting for the bulk of cases. There are human MERS cases that do not fall into either category of source and it is unclear if these acquired infection through some entirely separate route, or from cases that escaped diagnosis. c Hypothetical ways in which subclinical (when infection may not meet a previously defined clinical threshold of signs and/or symptoms) or asymptomatic (no obvious signs or measured, noticed or recalled symptoms of illness) MERS-CoV infection may be implicated in transmission DC sera could neutralise MERS-CoV while all Omani DC sera had high levels of specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody [85] . This indicated that DCs had in the past been infected by MERS-CoV, or a very similar virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this study, a host of peer-reviewed reports have looked at both DCs and other animals, and the possibility that they may host MERS-CoV infection. Seropositive DCs have been found throughout the Arabian Peninsula including Oman, the KSA, Qatar, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait as well as Sudan, Somalia, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia in Africa and the Canary Islands [85, [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] . Other animals tested include sheep, cows, pigs, horses, donkeys, mules, birds, water buffalo, goats, Bactrian camels, llamas and guanaco (south American camelids) but none had detectable neutralising antibody against MERS-CoV [4, 74, 78, 85, 86, 135, 136] . No virology or serology studies of human samples from areas in Africa where there are camels with a history of MERS-CoV have been reported to date. However,an absence of unexplained pneumonia that may be attributable to MERS-CoV infection may not signal the absence of virus among humans in each country but simply reflect a lack of expensive epidemiology studies conducted by resource-poor countries. It is thus unclear whether MERS-CoV, or an antigenically related CoV, is an unrecognized pathogen in these regions, perhaps circulating for even longer than it has been known in the Arabian Peninsula [133] .\n",
      "\n",
      "MERS-CoV RNA has also been detected in DC samples, and recovery of infectious virus has also been achieved from DC samples [4, 77, 117, 132, [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] . From some of these, full or majority length genomes of MERS-CoV have been sequenced [77, 137, 138] . DC versions of MERS-CoV were found to be as similar to each other, as were variants detected from different humans over time and across distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antibody screening assays have also detected crossreactive antibodies in sera. These were identified as such by screening sera against similar viruses, for example BCoV or HCoV-OC43 (as an antigenic facsimile for BCoV). It is possible that other MERS-CoV-like viruses also reside within DCs, but this does not detract from the definitive finding of MERS-CoV genetic sequences in both DCs and humans [117, 142, 143] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Screening studies have shown that juvenile DCs are more often positive for virus or viral RNA while older DCs are more likely to be seropositive and RNA or virus negative [76, 77, 144] . In adult DCs, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody, suggesting re-infection is possible [77, 144] . Viral loads among positive DCs can be very high [4, 76, 77, 139, 144] and DCs have been found positive both when ill with URT respiratory signs [77, 117, 142, 145] or when apparently healthy [137] . These findings indicate DCs host natural MERS-CoV infections. Furthermore, stored DC sera have revealed signs of MERS-CoV in DCs which date back over three decades (the earliest collected in 1983) [4, 133, 135] . Older sera have not been tested and so precisely how long DCs have been afflicted by MERS-CoV, whether the virus is enzootic among them, introduced to them decades or centuries ago from bats in Africa or the Arabian Peninsula, or they are the subject of regular but short-lived viral incursions from an as yet unknown host, cannot be answered.\n",

      "Researchers sought to determine a direction for infection; were DCs transmitting virus to humans or were humans infecting DCs? At a Qatari site, a farm owner and his employee became ill in mid-October 2013 and tested positive for MERS-CoV RNA in a sputum and throat swab sample, respectively. RT-rtPCRs found MERS-CoV RNA in 11 of 14 positive DC nasal swabs at the farm; six (43 %) positive by two or more assays [138] . The results indicated a recent outbreak had occurred in this herd; the first indication of MERS-CoV RNA found within DCs with a temporal association to human infections. Three positive DC samples were confirmed by sequencing a 358 nt portion of the spike gene; these sequences were identical to each other, again with close homology to other human and DC MERS-CoV sequences [138] . The DCs and human contacts yielded ORF1a and ORF4b sequences differing by only a single nucleotide each, clustering closely with the Hafr-Al-Batin_1_2013 variant [138] . Subsequent case studies found evidence of a concurrent human and DC infection and the direction of that infection was inferred to be from the ill DCs and to their human owners [117, 142, 146] . Partial genome sequences indicated that a human and a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive DC had been infected by a variant of the same virus, harbouring the same distinct pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms. [142] All nine DC in the owner's herd, serially sampled, reacted in a recombinant S1 antigen ELISA, with the two animals that had been RT-rtPCR positive showing a small, verifiable rise in antibody titre [142] . A rise in titre theoretically begins 10 to 21 days after DC infection [142] . The authors suggested that the rise in titre in DC sera which occurred alongside a declining RNA load, while the patient was actively ill and hospitalized, indicated that the DCs were infected first followed by the owner [117, 142] . BCoV antibodies were also present, and rising in one of the two RT-rtPCR positive animals but no animal's antibodies could neutralise BCoV infection [142] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Camel calving season occurs in the winter months (between late October and late February; Fig. 3 ) and this may be a time when there is increased risk to humans of spill-over due to new infections among naïve DC populations [128] . What role maternal camel antibody might play in delaying infection of calves remains unknown [128, 142] . Juvenile DCs appear to host active infection more often than adult DCs and thus the sacrificial slaughter of DCs, which must be five years of age or older (termed a thane), may not be accompanied by significant risk of exposure to infection. In contrast to earlier results, slaughterhouse workers who kill both younger and older DCs, may be an occupational group with significantly higher incidence of seropositivity to MERS-CoV when animals have active MERS-CoV infections [129, 139, [147] [148] [149] . Expanded virological investigations of African DCs may lead to more seropositive animals and geographic areas in which humans may be at risk. It is possible that there are areas where humans already harbour MERS-CoV infections that have not been identified because of an absence of laboratory surveillance. Virological investigations of bats may lead to findings of ancestral viruses and viral 'missing links' and identifying any other animal sources of zoonotic spread is important to inform options for reducing human exposures [56, 76] .\n",

      "Infectious MERS-CoV added to DC, goat or cow milk and stored at 4°C could be recovered at least 72 h later and, if stored at 22°C, recovery was possible for up to 48 h [150] . MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22°C but pasteurization completely ablated MERS-CoV infectivity [150] . In a subsequent study, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in the milk, nasal secretion and faeces of DCs from Qatar [151] .\n",
      "\n",
      "A single study has examined the ability of MERS-CoV to survive in the environment [150] . Plastic or steel surfaces were inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV at different temperature and relative humidity (RH) and virus recovery was attempted in cell culture. At high ambient temperature (30°C) and low RH (30 %) MERS-CoV remained viable for 24 h [150] . By comparison, a well known and efficently transmitted respiratory virus, influenza A virus, could not be recovered in culture beyond four hours under any conditions [150] . Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability only decreased 7 % at low RH at 20°C. In comparison, influenza A virus decreased by 95 % [150] . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV [152] . For context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable and airborne for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m. MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room's surfaces when occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient [153] . Whether MERS-CoV can remain adrift and infectious for extended periods (truly airborne) remains unknown. Such findings expand our understanding of the possibilities for droplets to transmit respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms. The nature and quality of air exchange, circulation and filtration are important variables in risk measurement and reduction as is the use of negative pressure rooms to contain known cases. Droplet spread between humans is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission and the need for droplet precautions was emphasized after the Al-Ahsa hospital, the KSA and the South Korean outbreaks [21, 23, 154, 155] . By extrapolation, aerosol-generating events involving DCs (urination, defecation, and preparation and consumption of DC products) should be factored into risk measurement and reduction efforts and messaged using appropriate context. The provision of evidence supporting the best formulation of personal protective equipment to be worn by HCWs who receive, manage or conduct procedures on infectious cases remains a priority.\n",

      "MERS-CoV was found and characterized because of its apparent association with severe, and therefore more obvious, illness in humans; we were the canaries in the coal mine. Sero-assays and prospective cohort studies have yet to determine the extent to which milder or asymptomatic cases contribute to MERS-CoV transmission chains. However, transmission of MERS-CoV is defined as sporadic (not sustained), intra-familial, often healthcare associated, inefficient and requiring close and prolonged contact [22, 31, 63, 93, 97, 102, 156] In a household study, 14 of 280 (5 %) contacts of 26 MERS-CoV positive index patients were RNA or antibody positive; the rate of general transmission, even in outbreaks is around 3 % [31] . It seems that the majority of human cases of MERS-CoV, even when numbers appear to increase suddenly, do not readily transmit to more than one other human so to date, the localized epidemic of MERS-CoV has not been self-sustaining [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] . That is to say, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) -the average number of infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible populationhas been close to one throughout various clusters and outbreaks. If R 0 was greater than 1, a sustained increase in case numbers would be expected. Some R o calculations may be affected by incomplete case contact tracing, limited community testing and how a case is defined. That MERS has had a constant presence in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 is due to ongoing, sporadic spill-over events from DCs amplified by poorly controlled hospital outbreaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first known MERS human-to-human transmission event was one characterized by acute LRT disease in a healthcare setting in Jordan. In stark contrast, a sero-survey of HCW who were sometimes in close and prolonged contact with the first, fatal MERS-CoV case in 2012 [162] , found none of the HCW had seroconverted four months later, despite an absence of eye protection and variable compliance with required PPE standards [162] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Early on in the MERS story, samples for testing were mostly collected from patients with severe illness and not those with milder acute respiratory tract infections. Contacts of confirmed MERS cases were often observed for clinical illness, but not tested. These omissions may have confounded our understanding of MERS-CoV transmission and biased early data towards higher numbers of seriously ill and hospitalized patients, inflating the apparent proportion of fatal cases. Case-control studies were not a focus. As testing paradigms changed and contacts were increasingly tested, more asymptomatic and mild infections were recognized [163] .\n",
      "\n",
      "A rise in the cases termed asymptomatic (which enlarge the denominator for calculations of the proportion of fatal cases, defined in [164] ) resulted in a drop in the proportion of fatal cases during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak. Historically, such rises are consistent with changing definitions and laboratory responses and clinical management of a newly discovered virus infection that was first noted only among the severely ill. Upon follow-up, over three-quarters of such MERS-CoV RNA positive people did recall having one or more symptoms at the time, despite being reported as asymptomatic [165] raising some question over the reliability of other reported data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proportion of fatal MERS cases within the KSA compared to outside the KSA, as well as the age, and sex distribution change in different ways when comparing MERS outbreaks. Approximately 43 % of MERS cases (549 of 1277) in the KSA were fatal betwen 2012 and December 2015 while 21 % (72 of 330) died among those occurring outside of the KSA. The total number of male cases always outnumber females and the proportion of male deaths is always greater than the proportion of females who die. However the proportion of male deaths from total males with MERS is a similar figure to that for females. In the KSA, there is a greater proportion of younger males among cases and deaths than were observed from the 2015 South Korean or the Jeddah-2014 outbreaks (Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). Why these aspects have differed may be due to differences in the time to presentation and diagnosis, the nature and quality of supportive care, the way a person became infected (habits, exposure to a human or zoonotic source, viral load, route of infection) or the extent to which different populations are burdened by underlying diseases [40] .\n",
      "\n",
      "As a group, HCWs comprised 16 % of MERS cases in the KSA and South Korea. It is apparent that the weekly proportion of infected HCWs increases alongside each steep rise in overall detections (Fig. 5) . In May 2013, the WHO published guidelines for IPC during care of probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in a healthcare setting [166] . This is explainable because to date, each case rise has been intimately associated with healthcare-facility related outbreaks [118] . These rises in MERS-CoV detections can decrease the average age during each event because HCWs are usually younger than inpatients with MERS. Healthcare facilities have been a regular target for suggested improvements aimed at improving infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures [115, 118] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the analysis of MERS-CoV genetics has been performed using high throughput or \"deep\" sequencing methods for complete genome deduction [167] [168] [169] . MERS-CoV was the first subject of such widespread use of deep sequencing to study an emerging viral outbreak with global reach. The technique can produce genomic [207] [208] [209] . Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal blog [210] length coverage in a single experiment with highly repetitious measurement of each nucleotide position [52, 140] . Despite assays having been published early on, subgenomic sequencing, once the mainstay of viral outbreak studies, has less often been published during MERS-CoV characterization [48] . As more genomes from both humans and DCs have been characterized, two clades have become apparent; A and B (Fig. 6) . Clade A contains only human-derived MERS-CoV genomes from Jordan, while Clade B comprises the majority of human and camel genomes deduced thus far [168] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Two studies during 2015, one looking at Jeddah-2014 MERS-CoV variants and another looking at a variant exported from South Korea to China, have now identified signs of genetic recombination among MERS-CoV variants. While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur [170] [171] [172] . Shared identity implies that the major source for human acquisition is the DC, rather than another animal, although more testing of other animal species is needed to confirm that conclusion. Over a month, a DC virus sequenced on different occasions did not change at all indicating a degree of genomic stability in its host, supporting that DCs are the natural, rather than intermediate, host for the MERS-CoV we know today [77] . To date, recombination has been localised to breakpoints near the boundary between ORF1a and ORF1b regions, within the spike gene [170] and in the ORF1b region (Fig. 2) [172] . It is not unexpected that recombination should occur since it is well known among other CoVs [124] and because the majority of MERS-CoV whole genomes collected from samples spanning three years (2012-2015) and from humans, camels and different countries have shown close genetic identity to each other, with just enough subtle variation to support outbreak investigations so long as whole genome sequencing is applied [52, 77, 135, 138, 168, [173] [174] [175] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in genome sequence may herald alterations to virus transmissibility, replication, persistence, lethality or response to future drugs. If we have prior knowledge of the impact of genetic changes because of thorough characterization studies, we can closely Fig. 6 The genetic relationship between MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences (downloaded from GenBank using the listed accession numbers and from virological.org [212] ). This neighbour joining tree was created in MEGA v6 using an alignment of human and DCderived MERS-CoV sequences (Geneious v8.1 [211] ). Clades are indicated next to dark (Clade A) or pale (Clade B) blue vertical bars. Camel icons denote genomes from DCs. Healthcare or community outbreaks are boxed and labelled using previously described schemes [212, 213] monitor the genomic regions and better understand any changes in transmission or disease patterns as they occur. Genetic mutations noted during the largest of human outbreaks, Jeddah-2014, did not impart any major replicative or immunomodulatory changes when compared to earlier viral variants in vitro [156, 176] . However, we understand very little of the phenotypic outcomes that result from subtle genetic change in MERS-CoV genomes. To date no clinical relevance or obvious in vivo changes to viral replication, shedding or transmission has been reported or attributed to mutations or to new recombinant viruses [156] . But vigilance and larger, more contemporary and in vivo studies are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genome sequence located to a distinct clade were identified from an Egyptian DC that was probably imported from Sudan. This does not fit into either of the current clades [125, 168, 177] . A virus sequenced from a Neoromicia capensis bat was more closely related to MERS-CoV than other large bat-derived sequences had been to that point, but the genome of a variant of a MERS-CoV has yet to be discovered and deduced from any bat [125] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyses of MERS-CoV genomes have shown that most single nucleotide differences among variants were located in the last third of the genome (Fig. 2) , which encodes the spike protein and accessory proteins [168] . At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and codons 158 (N-terminal region), 460 (RBD), 1020 (in heptad repeat 1), 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change [140, 169] . The spike protein had not changed in the recombinant MERS-CoV genome identified in China in 2015 but was reported to have varied at a higher rate than that for complete MERS-CoV genomes, among South Korean variants [172, 178] . This highlights that subgenomic regions may not always contain enough genetic diversity to prove useful for differentiating viral variants. Despite this, one assay amplifying a 615 nucleotide fragment of the spike S2 domain gene for Sanger sequencing agreed with the results generated by the sequencing of a some full genomes and was useful to define additional sequence groupings [177] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Genomic sequence can also be used to define the geographic boundaries of a cluster or outbreak and monitor its progress, based on the similarity of the variants found among infected humans and animals when occurring together, or between different sites and times (Fig. 6 ) [169] . This approach was employed when defining the geographically constrained MERS hospital outbreak in Al-Ahsa, which occurred between 1 st April and 23 rd May 2013, as well as clusters in Buraidah and a community outbreak in Hafr Al-Batin, the KSA. Genomic sequencing identified that approximately 12 MERS-CoV detections from a community outbreak in Hafr Al-Batin between June and August 2013 may have been triggered by an index case becoming infected through DC contact [175] . Sequencing MERS-CoV genomes from the 2013 Al-Ahsa hospital outbreak indicated that multiple viral variants contributed to the cases but that most were similar enough to each other to be consistent with human-tohuman transmission. Molecular epidemiology has revealed otherwise hidden links in transmission chains encompassing a period of up to five months [179] . However, most outbreaks have not continued for longer than two to three months and so opportunities for the virus to adapt further to humans through co-infection and sustained serial passage have been rare [169] . In Riyadh-2014, genetic evidence supported the likelihood of multiple external introductions of virus, implicating a range of healthcare facilities in an event that otherwise looked contiguous [23, 168, 179] . Riyadh is a nexus for camel and human travel and has had more MERS cases than any other region of the KSA to date but also harbours a wide range of MERS-CoV variants [128, 167, 179] . However the South Korean outbreak originated from a single infected person, resulting in three to four generations of cases [180, 181] . Studies of this apparently recombinant viral variant did not find an increased evolutionary rate and no sign of virus adaptation thus the outbreak seems to have been driven by circumstance rather than circumstance together with mutation [181] .\n",

      "For many MERS cases detected outside the Arabian Peninsula, extensive contact tracing has been performed and the results described in detail. Contact tracing is essential to contain the emergence and transmission of a new virus and today it is supported by molecular epidemiology. Although it is an expensive and time consuming process, contact tracing can identify potential new infections and through active or passive monitoring, react more rapidly if disease does develop. Results of contact tracing to date have found that onward transmission among humans is an infrequent event. For example, there were 83 contacts, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, of a case treated in Germany who travelled from the UAE but no sign of virus or antibody were found in any of them [73] . The very first MERS case had made contact with 56 HCWs and 48 others, but none developed any indication of infection [162] . In a study of 123 contacts of a case treated in France, only seven matched the definition for a possible case and were tested; one who had shared a 20 m 2 hospital room while in a bed 1.5 m away from the index case for a prolonged period was positive [26] . None of the contacts of the first two MERS cases imported into the USA in 2014 contained any MERS-CoV footprint [182] and none of the 131 contacts of two travellers returning to the Netherlands developed MERS-CoV antibodies or tested RNA positive [25, 183] . Analyses of public data reveal many likely instances of nosocomial acquisition of infection in the Arabian Peninsula and these data may be accompanied by some details noting contact with a known case or facility. One example identified the likely role of a patient with a subclinical infection, present in a hospital during their admission for other reasons, as the likeliest index case triggering a family cluster [93] . Contact tracing was a significant factor in the termination of a 2015 outbreak involving multiple South Korean hospitals [184] . Such studies demonstrate the necessity of finding and understanding a role for mild and asymptomatic cases, together with restricting close contact or prolonged exposure of infected people to others, especially older family members and friends with underlying disease (Fig. 4c) .\n",
      "\n",
      "The hospital-associated outbreak in Jeddah in 2014 was the largest and most rapid accumulation of MERS-CoV detections to date. The greatest number of MERS-CoV detections of any month on record occurred in Jeddah in April. The outbreak was mostly (>60 % of cases) associated with human-to-human spread within hospital environments and resulted from a lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control [37, 185, 186] . A rise in fatalities followed the rapid increase in case numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015 two large outbreaks occurred. South Korea was the site of the first large scale outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula and produced the first cases in both South Korea and China, occurring between May and July 2015. This was closely followed by a distinct outbreak in Ar Riyad province in the KSA which appeared to come under control in early November.\n",
      "\n",
      "After staying in Bahrain for two weeks, a 68 year old male (68 M) travelled home to South Korea via Qatar, arriving free of symptoms on the 4 th May 2015 [187] . He developed fever, myalgia and a cough nearly a week later (11 th ). He visited a clinic as an outpatient between the 12 th and 15 th of May and was admitted to Hospital A on the 15 th [188] . He was discharged from Hospital A on the 17 th then visited and was admitted to the emergency department of Hospital B on the 18 th . During this second stay, a sputum sample was taken and tested positive for MERS-CoV on the 20 th [187, 188] , triggering transfer to the designated isolation treatment facility. Over a period of 10 days, the index case was seen at three different hospitals, demonstrating a key feature of \"hospital shopping\" that shaped the South Korean outbreak. Approximately 34 people were infected during this time [187] . In total 186 cases were generated in this outbreak, all linked through a single transmission chain to 68 M; 37 cases died [189] . In South Korea, the national health insurance system provides for relatively low cost medical care, defraying some costs by making family members responsible for a portion of the ministration of the sick, resulting in them sometimes staying for long periods in the rooms that often have more than four beds in them [24] . Other factors thought to have enabled this outbreak included unfamiliarity of local clinicians with MERS, ease with which the public can visit and be treated by tertiary hospitals, the custom of visiting sick friends and relatives in hospitals, the hierarchical nature of Korean society, crowded emergency rooms, poor IPC measures, a lack of negative pressure isolation rooms and poor inter-hospital communication of patient disease histories [24, [190] [191] [192] . All of the reported transmission occurred across three or four generations and apart from one unknown source, were all hospital-acquired [24, 120, 181, [193] [194] [195] . Few clinical details about these cases have been reported to date and detail on transmission and contact tracing is minimal. The hospitals involved were initially not identified, governmental guidance and actions produced confusing messages and there was very limited communication at all early on which resulted in unnecessary concern, distrust and a distinct economic impact [191, [196] [197] [198] . Early in the outbreak, a infected traveller, the son of an identified case in South Korea, passed through Hong Kong on his way to China where he was located, isolated and cared for in China [91, 199, 200] . No contacts became ill. The outbreak was brought under control in late July/ early August [201] after improved IPC measures were employed, strong contact tracing monitoring and quarantine, expanded laboratory testing, hospitals were better secured, specialized personnel were dispatched to manage cases and international cooperation increased [202, 203] . A review of public data showed that, as for MERS in the KSA, older age and the presence of underlying disease were significantly associated with a fatal outcome in South Korea. [40] Even though R 0 is <1, super-spreading events facilitated by circumstances created in healthcare settings and characterized by cluster sizes over 150, such as this one, are not unexpected from MERS-CoV infection [204] . The dynamic of an outbreak depends on the R 0 and an individual's viral shedding patterns, contact type and frequency, hospital procedures and population structure and density [204] .\n",
      "\n",
      "In the region of Ar Riyad, including the capital city of Riyadh, a hospital based cluster began, within a single hospital, from late June 2015 [205] . By mid-September there had been approximately170 cases reported but the outbreak appeared to been brought under control in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "It became apparent early on that MERS-CoV spread relatively ineffectively from human-to-human. Despite ongoing and possibly seasonal introduction of virus to the human population via infected DCs and perhaps other animals yet to be identified, the vast majority of MERS-CoV transmission has occurred from infected to uninfected humans in close and prolonged contact through circumstances created by poor infection control in health care settings. This opportunistic virus has had its greatest impact on those with underlying diseases and such vulnerable people, sometimes suffering multiple comorbidities, have been most often associated with hospitals, creating a perfect storm of exposure, transmission and mortality. It remains unclear if this group are uniquely affected by MERS-CoV or if other respiratory virus infections, including those from HCoVs, produce a similarly serious impact. In South Korea, a single imported case created an outbreak of 185 cases and 36 deaths that had a disproportionate impact on economic performance, community behaviour and trust in government and the health care system. Household human-to human transmission occurs but is also limited. Educational programs will be essential tools for combatting the spread of MERS-CoV both within urban and regional communities and for the health care setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vigilance remains important for containment since MERS-CoV is a virus with a genetic makeup that has been observed for only three years and is not stable. Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective. Global alignment of case definitions would further aid accurate calculation of a case fatality ratio by including subclinical case numbers. Whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV travel and variation and although it remains a tool for experts, it appears to be the best tool for the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "MERS and SARS have some clinical similarities but they also diverge significantly [206] . Defining characteristics include the higher PFC among MERS cases (above 50 % in 2013 and currently at 30-40 %; well above the 9 % of SARS) and the higher association between fatal MERS and older males with underlying comorbidities. For the viruses, MERS-CoV has a broader tropism, grows more rapidly in vitro, more rapidly induces cytopathogenic change, triggers distinct transcriptional responses, makes use of a different receptor, induces a more proinflammatory state and has a delayed innate antiviral response compared to SARS-CoV.\n",
      "\n",
      "There appears to be a 2-3 % prevalence of MERS-CoV in the KSA with a 5 % chance of secondary transmission within the household. There is an increased risk of infection through certain occupations at certain times and a much greater chance for spread to other humans during circumstances created by humans, which drives more effective transmission than any R 0 would predict on face value. Nonetheless, despite multiple mass gatherings that have afforded the virus many millions of opportunities to spread, there have remarkably been no reported outbreaks of MERS or MERS-CoV during or immediately after these events. There is no evidence that MERS-CoV is a virus of pandemic concern. Nonetheless, hospital settings continue to describe MERS cases and outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula. As long as we facilitate the spread of MERS-CoV among our most vulnerable populations, the world must remain on alert for cases which may be exported more frequently when a host country with infected camel reservoirs is experiencing human clusters or outbreaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MERS-CoV appears to be an enzootic virus infecting the DC URT with evidence of recent genetic recombination. It may once have had its origins among bats, but evidence is lacking and the relevance of that to today's ongoing epidemic is academic. Thanks to quick action, the sensitive and rapid molecular diagnostic tools required to achieve rapid and sensitive detection goal have been in place and made widely available since the virus was reported in 2012. RT-PCR testing of LRT samples remains the gold standard for MERS-CoV confirmation. Serological tools continue to emerge but they are in need of further validation using samples from mild and asymptomatic infections and a densely sampled cohort study to follow contacts of new cases may address this need. Similarly, the important question of whether those who do shed MERS-CoV RNA for extended periods are infectious while appearing well, continues to go unanswered. It is even unclear just how many 'asymptomatic' infections have been described and reported correctly which in turn raises questions about the reliability of other clinical data collection to date. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the course of the past three years, understanding what is happening in, and the interplay between, camel, environment and human is still in its infancy.\n",

      "Abstract: Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-18. We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B proteins stimulate IL-1β secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein. K(+) efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for SARS-CoV 3a-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results highlight the importance of viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins, in virus-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n",

      "Text: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the genus Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb in length. The 5 two-thirds of the genome encodes large polyprotein precursors, open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF1b, which are proteolytically cleaved to generate 16 non-structural proteins (Tan et al., 2005) . The 3 one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and non-structural proteins, along with a set of accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b) (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Tan et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV is the etiological agent of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . At least 8,098 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection, with a fatality rate of 9.6%, were reported to the World Health Organization from November 2002 to July 2003. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, were detected in autopsy tissues from SARS patients (He et al., 2006) . Although dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in lung injury and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.\n",

      "The innate immune systems utilizes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Medzhitov, 2001; Kawai and Akira, 2010) . Recognition of virus infection plays an important role in limiting virus replication at the early stages of infection. Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including virus infection (Bauernfeind et al., 2011) . Four models describing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been proposed thus far (Hornung and Latz, 2010; Schroder et al., 2010; Tschopp and Schroder, 2010) . First, the disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations, including K + efflux and Ca 2+ influx, play an important role (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2007; Petrilli et al., 2007; Arlehamn et al., 2010; Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2012; Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013) . Second, cathepsin B and L, which are specific lysosomal cysteine proteases, are though to play a role after phagocytosis of cholesterol crystals (Duewell et al., 2010) , fibrillar peptide amyloid-beta , silica crystals, and aluminum salts . Third is the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mitochondrial DNA from damaged mitochondria (Zhou et al., , 2011 Nakahira et al., 2011; Shimada et al., 2012) . Finally, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Upon activation, the NLRP3 is recruited to the mitochondria via association with mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) or mitofusin 2 expressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane Subramanian et al., 2013) ; these molecules then recruit the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. This event activates the downstream molecule, caspase-1, which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms and stimulates their secretion (Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015) .\n",
      "\n",
      "It is increasingly evident that NLRP3 detects RNA viruses by sensing the cellular damage or distress induced by viroporins (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) , transmembrane pore-forming proteins, encoded by certain RNA viruses; these proteins alter membrane permeability to ions by forming membrane channels (Tan et al., 2005; Chen and Ichinohe, 2015) . A recent study shows that the SARS-CoV E protein, which comprise only 76 amino acids, forms Ca 2+ -permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . Although the E and 3a proteins of SARS-CoV, which comprise 274 amino acids and contain three transmembrane domains (Zeng et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006) , are thought to act as Na + /K + and K + channels, respectively (Wilson et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006; Torres et al., 2007; Parthasarathy et al., 2008; Pervushin et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011) , the role of the 3a protein in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we examined the role of the 3a protein in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n",

To generate the plasmids pLenti6-E-V5His, pLenti6-3a-V5His, and pLenti-M-V5His, cDNA fragments of E, 3a, and M were amplified from pcDNA3.1D-E-V5His, pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His, and pcDNA3.1D-M-V5His using specific primer sets and then ligated into pLenti6-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen). To generate plasmids pCA7-flag-E, pCA7-flag-3a, and pCA7flag-M, pCA7-HA-E, pCA7-HA-3a, and pCA7-HA-M, cDNA fragments of E, 3a, and M were amplified from pcDNA3.1D-E-V5His, pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His, and pcDNA3.1D-M-V5His using specific primer sets, digested with EcoR I and Not I, and subcloned into the EcoR I-Not I sites of the pCA7-flag-ASC plasmid or pCA7-HA-M2 plasmid, respectively (Ito et al., 2012) .

At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). And the lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes.

The supernatants containing lentiviruses were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter (Millipore) at 72-96 h post-transfection (Ito et al., 2012) .

      "We previously demonstrated that the influenza virus M2 protein (a proton-selective ion channel), its H37G mutant (which has lost its proton selectivity and enables the transport of other cations such as Na + and K + ), and the EMCV 2B protein (a Ca 2+ channel) stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012) . In addition, the SARS-CoV E protein acts as a Ca 2+ -permeable ion channels that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto- Torres et al., 2015) . The fact that 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as viroporin prompted us to examine whether it also triggers inflammasome activation. Thus, we first generated lentivirus plasmids expressing V5-tagged proteins and confirmed their expression in HEK293FT cells by immunoblot analysis (Figures 1A-C) . We next transduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed BMMs with the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E, 3a, M, influenza virus M2, or EMCV 2B proteins. Consistent with previous reports (Ichinohe et al., Figure 1D) . Similarly, the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins stimulated IL-1β release from LPS-primed BMMs ( Figure 1D) . Furthermore, IL-1β secretion from LPSprimed BMMs co-infected with E-and 3a-expressing lentiviruses was significantly higher than that from SARS-CoV E-expressing lentivirus-infected cells ( Figure 1E) . These data indicated that the expression of SARS-CoV viroporin 3a is sufficient to stimulate IL-1β secretion by LPS-primed BMMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous studies demonstrated that the N-terminal 40 amino acids of the SARS-CoV E protein are important for ion channel formation, and that mutations N15A and V25F [located in the transmembrane domain (from amino acid residues 7-38)] prevent ion conductivity (Wilson et al., 2004; Torres et al., 2007; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) . In addition, the SARS-CoV 3a protein contains a cysteine-rich domain (amino acid residues 127-133) that is involved in the formation of a homodimer to generate the ion channel (Lu et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2009) . Thus, mutation of the cysteine-rich domain blocks the ion conductivity by the 3a protein (Chan et al., 2009) . To this end, we substituted amino acids Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133 within the cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV 3a protein with serine to generate a lentivirus expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutant, 3a-CS (Chan et al., 2009;  Figure 2A) . To test whether the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is required to stimulate secretion of IL-1β, we transduced LPSprimed BMMs with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E, V25F, 3a, 3a-CS, or M proteins. Consistent with a previous report (Nieto -Torres et al., 2015) , we found that the V25F mutant lentivirus failed to stimulate IL-1β release from BMMs ( Figure 2B) . Notably, the 3a-CS mutant completely abrogated IL-1β secretion (Figure 2B) , suggesting that the ion channel activity of the 3a protein is required for SARS-CoV 3a-induced IL-1β secretion.\n",

      "FIGURE 4 | NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV 3a.

      "3a protein was expressed in HeLa cells, we observed two main distribution patterns. Consistent with previous reports (Yu et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2005) , the 3a protein localized to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 3A ). In addition, the 3a proteins concentrated in spot structures, which mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 3B ). By contrast, the 3a-CS mutant was concentrated in the Golgi apparatus rather than in the ER and did not form spot structures (Figures 3A,B) . We next examined the intracellular localization of NLRP3. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome led to a redistribution from the cytosol to the perinuclear space, a process considered as a hallmark of NLRP3 activation (Zhou et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2013; Moriyama et al., 2016) . Although cells expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutants 3a-CS or V25F uniformly expressed NLRP3 throughout the cytoplasm, it was redistributed to the perinuclear region in SARS-CoV 3a-or E-expressing cells (Figure 4) . Together, these data provide evidence that the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both K + Efflux and ROS Production Are Involved in the IL-1β Release Induced by the SARS-CoV 3a Protein\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we investigated the mechanism by which SARS-CoV 3a triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A previous study showed that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) . In addition, K + efflux is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Mariathasan et al., 2006; Petrilli et al., 2007) . These observations prompted us to examine whether K + efflux is required for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. To this end, BMMs in K + -rich medium were infected with influenza A virus or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins. In agreement with a previous result (Ichinohe et al., 2010) , we found that IL-1β secretion caused by influenza virus was completely blocked when the extracellular K + concentration was increased to 130 mM ( Figure 5A) . The inhibitory effect of the K + -rich medium was also observed when cells were stimulated with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins ( Figure 5B ). Since mitochondrial ROS are important for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Nakahira et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011) , we next stimulated BMMs with extracellular ATP or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins in the presence or absence of the antioxidant, Mito-TEMPO, a scavenger that is specific for mitochondrial ROS Trnka et al., 2009) . As reported previously (Nakahira et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012) , treatment of BMMs with Mito-TEMPO completely blocked IL-1β secretion in response to ATP ( Figure 6A) . Similarly, IL-1β release induced by the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins was significantly inhibited by Mito-TEMPO ( Figure 6B) . These observations indicate that the SARS-CoV 3a protein disrupts intracellular ionic concentrations and causes mitochondrial damages, thereby activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we found that the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, both K + efflux and mitochondrial ROS production are required for SARS-CoV 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far, several models have been proposed to explain NLRP3 inflammasome activation by RNA viruses. First, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Second, viroporins encoded by RNA viruses activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . In the case of influenza virus, the proton-selective M2 ion channel in the acidic trans-Golgi network activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . Interestingly, an M2 mutant in which histidine was substituted with glycine at position 37 (H37G), causing loss of proton selectivity, enables transport of other cations (i.e., Na + and K + ), thereby leading to enhanced secretion of IL-1β from LPS-primed BMMs and dendritic cells when compared with the wild-type M2 protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the 2B proteins of EMCV, poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), and human rhinovirus (a member of the Picornaviridae family) triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing Ca 2+ flux from the ER and Golgi compartments (Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013) . Furthermore, hepatitis C virus stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production though its p7 viroporin (Negash et al., 2013; Farag et al., 2017) . Third, a recent study has demonstrated that the 3D protein of EV71 directly interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome complex (Wang et al., 2017) .\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of SARS-CoV, the viroporin E forms forms Ca 2+permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Yue et al., 2018) . Although alanine substitution at Cys-133, which is required for dimer or tetramer formation (Lu et al., 2006) , still allows activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by interacting with caspase-1 (Yue et al., 2018) , the ion channel activity-loss mutant 3a-CS (Cys-to-Ser substitution at positions Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133) (Chan et al., 2009 ) completely abrogated IL-1β secretion from LPS-primed BMMs, suggesting that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV has the ability to induce the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by multiple mechanisms. Previous studies show that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV is localized to the plasma membrane (Minakshi and Padhan, 2014) and acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) , thereby (presumably) stimulating the K + efflux at the plasma membrane. Indeed, we found that IL-1β secretion caused by the 3a protein was significantly inhibited when the extracellular K + concentration increased to 130 mM. Although it remains unclear whether another viroporin 8a of SARS-CoV (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, these data highlights the importance of viroporins in SARS-CoV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A better understanding of the mechanism that governs the NLRP3 inflammasome will facilitate the development of more effective interventions for the treatment of infectious diseases and increase our understanding of viral pathogenesis.\n"

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Planning public health responses against pandemic influenza relies on predictive models by which the impact of different intervention strategies can be evaluated. Research has to date rather focused on producing predictions for certain localities or under specific conditions, than on designing a publicly available planning tool which can be applied by public health administrations. Here, we provide such a tool which is reproducible by an explicitly formulated structure and designed to operate with an optimal combination of the competing requirements of precision, realism and generality. RESULTS: InfluSim is a deterministic compartment model based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model by clinical and demographic parameters relevant for pandemic preparedness planning. It allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses, hospitalizations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness, all of which may be associated with economic aspects. The software is programmed in Java, operates platform independent and can be executed on regular desktop computers. CONCLUSION: InfluSim is an online available software which efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza. It can reproduce the infection dynamics of pandemic influenza like complex computer simulations while offering at the same time reproducibility, higher computational performance and better operability.\n",

      "Text: Preparedness against pandemic influenza has become a high priority public health issue and many countries that have pandemic preparedness plans [1] . For the design of such plans, mathematical models and computer simulations play an essential role because they allow to predict and compare the effects of different intervention strategies [2] . The outstanding significance of the tools for purposes of intervention optimization is limited by the fact that they cannot maximize realism, generality and precision at the same time [3] . Public health planners, on the other hand, wish to have an optimal combination of these properties, because they need to formulate intervention strategies which can be generalized into recommendations, but are sufficiently realistic and precise to satisfy public health requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Published influenza models which came into application, are represented by two extremes: generalized but oversimplified models without dynamic structure which are publicly available (e.g. [4] ), and complex computer simulations which are specifically adjusted to real conditions and/or are not publicly available (e.g. [5, 6] ). The complexity of the latter simulations, however, is not necessary for a reliable description of infection dynamics in large populations [7] . A minimum requirement for a pandemic influenza planning tool is a dynamic modelling structure which allows investigation of time-dependent variables like incidence, height of the epidemic peak, antiviral availability etc. The tool should, on the other hand, be adjustable to local conditions to adequately support the pandemic preparedness plans of different countries which involve considerably different assumptions (Table 1) .\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we describe a publicly available influenza pandemic preparedness planning tool [8] which is designed to meet the requirements in preparedness planning. It is based on an explicitly formulated dynamic system which allows addressing time-dependent factors. It is sufficiently flexible to evaluate the impact of most candidate interventions and to consider local conditions like demographic and economic factors, contact patterns or constraints within the public health system. In subsequent papers we will also provide examples and applications of this model for various interventions, like antiviral treatment and social distancing measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is based on a system of 1,081 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model. Demographic parameters reflect the situation in Germany in 2005, but can be adjusted to other countries. Epidemiologic and clinic values were taken from the literature (see Tables 1,  2 , 3, 4, 5, 6 and the sources quoted there). Pre-set values can be varied by sliders and input fields to make different assumptions on the transmissibility and clinical severity of a new pandemic strain, to change the costs connected to medical treatment or work loss, or to simply apply the simulation to different demographic settings. Model properties can be summarized as follows. The mathematical formulation of this model is presented in detail in the online supporting material. The corresponding source code, programmed in Java, and further information can be downloaded from [8] .\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the German National Pandemic Preparedness Plan [9] , the total population is divided in age classes, each of which is subdivided into individuals of low and high risk ( Table 2) . Transmission between these age classes is based on a contact matrix (Table 3) which is scaled such that the model with standard parameter values yields a given basic reproduction number R0. Values for the R0 associated with an influenza strain with pandemic potential are suggested to lie between 2 and 3 [10] . This value is higher than the effective reproduction number which has been estimated to be slightly lower than 2 [11, 12] . As a standard parameter, we use R0 = 2.5 which means that cases infect on average 2.5 individuals if everybody is susceptible and if no interventions are performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susceptible individuals who become infected, incubate the infection, then become fully contagious and finally develop protective immunity (Table 4) . A fraction of cases remains asymptomatic; others become moderately sick or clinically ill (i.e. they need medical help). Depending on the combination of age and risk group, a fraction of the clinically ill cases needs to be hospitalized, and an agedependent fraction of hospitalized cases may die from the disease ( Table 5 ). This partitioning of the cases into four categories allows combining the realistic description of the transmission dynamics with an easy calculation of the resources consumed during an outbreak. The degree and duration of contagiousness of a patient depend on the course of the disease; the latter furthermore depends on the age of the patient (Table 5) . Passing through the incubation and contagious period is modelled in several stages which allows for realistic distributions of the sojourn times ( Table 4 ). The last two stages of the incubation period are used as early infectious period during which the patient can already spread the disease. Infectiousness is highest after onset of symptoms and thereafter declines geometrically (Table 6 ). Clinically ill patients seek medical help on average one day after onset of symptoms. Very sick patients are advised to withdraw to their home until their disease is over, whereas extremely sick patients need to be hospitalized and may die from the disease (Table 4) . After the end of their contagious period, clinically ill patients go through a convalescent period before they can resume their ordinary life and go back to work (Table 4) .\n",
      "\n",
      "We provide some examples of model output of InfluSim [8] , version 2.0, by means of four sensitivity analyses; further investigations will be presented elsewhere. Figure 1 shows the graphical user interface of the software which is divided into input and output windows. The user may set new values in the input fields or move sliders to almost simultaneously obtain new results for the course of an epidemic in a given population. Figures 2A and 2B show pandemic waves which result from varying the basic reproduction number from 1.5 to 4.0. Using the standard parameter values as given in Tables 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6 and omitting all interventions in a town of 100,000 inhabitants results in a pandemic wave which lasts for about ten weeks (Figure 2A , with R 0 = 2.5). The peak of the pandemic wave is reached after six to seven weeks, with a daily incidence of up to 2,340 influenza patients seeking medical help, with up to 280 hospital beds occupied by influenza cases and with up to 14,000 out of 60,000 working adults unable to go to work because of illness or convalescence. These results depend on the assumptions concerning the yet unknown contagiousness and pathogenicity of the virus. Figures 2C and 2D show how the shape of the curves depends on the course of contagiousness: the pandemic wave proceeds relative slowly if the contagiousness does not change during the infectious period (x 50 = 50%), but proceeds quickly if the contagiousness is highest after onset of symptoms and decreases thereafter (x 50 > 50%).\n",
      "\n",
      "The influenza pandemic preparedness planning tool InfluSim stands between simple spreadsheet models and sophisticated stochastic computer simulations. It describes a pandemic wave within a homogeneously mixing population like a town or city, but surprisingly produces the same dynamics as individual-based simulations which explicitly consider geographic spread through the US (cf. [6] and [5] with Figure 2 using R 0 = 2). Similar observations were made with a simple deterministic compartmental model [7] . Stochastic models are known to behave quasi-deterministically when the simulated population becomes very large.\n",
      "\n",
      "A further reason for the congruence of complex stochastic and simple deterministic models must lie in the incredi-bly quick way in which pandemic influenza spreads geographically. Unless being controlled at the place of origin [12, 13] , a pandemic starting in a far-off country will lead to multiple introductions [14] into the large industrialized nations where it can be expected to quickly spread to neighbouring towns and to rural areas. The large populations which have to be considered susceptible to a pandemic virus and the quick geographic spread tend to diminish the differences between the results of sophisticated individual-based and simple deterministic models.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a deterministic model like InfluSim cannot reliably represent effects originating from stochasticity, from effects in small populations, or from heterogeneities. Examples are: (i) a geographically limited spread and fairly effective control measures can imply that the epidemic affects only a small population and thus, may be strongly influenced by stochastic events [15] [16] [17] ; (ii) transmission which predominantly occurs in households or hospitals, or which is driven by other substantial features of the contact network is not in agreement with the assumption of homogeneous mixing in the deterministic model cannot reliably predict the spread of infection [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . In particular, (iii) super-spreading events can substantially change the course of an epidemic compared to the deterministic prediction [24] [25] [26] [27] . Apart from such factors, the predictability of intervention success is generally subject to uncertainties in the choice of parameter values, Assumed scenarios and outcomes of pandemic preparedness plans. * Gross attack rate (i.e. clinically ill and moderately ill cases). A population of N = 100,000 inhabitants of Germany is subdivided according to age a and risk category r. We assume that all age groups are fully susceptible at begin of the outbreak. A fraction of F a = 6% of all children (age < 20 years) are regarded as being under high risk (r = r 1 ) after an influenza infection whereby the remaining 94% are under low risk (r = r 2 ). The high risk fractions of working adults (ages 20-59) and elderly (ages 60+) are F a = 14% and F a = 47%, respectively. Source: [9] demanding additional efforts like Bayesian approaches [28] to evaluate the reliability of predictions [29] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandemic preparedness plans must consider constraints and capacities of locally operating public health systems. The time-dependent solutions of InfluSim allow assessing peak values of the relevant variables, such as outpatients, hospitalizations and deaths. Various interventions may be combined to find optimal ways to reduce the total number of cases, to lower the peak values or to delay the peak, hoping that at least part of the population may benefit from a newly developed vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Special care was taken when implementing a variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions which will be discussed in subsequent papers. Despite its comprehensible structure, the model does not suffer from over-simplifications common to usual compartment models. Instead of implicitly using exponentially distributed sojourn times, we have implemented realistically distributed delays. For example, the model considers that individuals may transmit infection before onset of symptoms, and that some cases may remain asymptomatic, but still infecting others. Such features have serious implications for the success of targeted control measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "InfluSim is freely accessible, runs on a regular desktop computer and produces results within a second after changing parameter values. The user-friendly interface and the ease at which results can be generated make this program a useful public health planning tool. Although we have taken care of providing a bug-free program, including the source code, the user is encouraged to treat results with due caution, to test it, and to participate in bug-reports and discussions on the open-source platform [30] which also provides regular updates of InfluSim. \n",

A fraction f V (t) of all severe and a fraction f X (t) of all extremely severe cases who visit the doctor within D T days after onset of symptoms are offered antiviral treatment, given that its supply has not yet been exhausted.

This imposes some variability to the maximum time until which treatment can be given, which may even improve the realism of the model with respect to real-life scenarios.

      "Transmissibility and severity are the 2 most critical factors that determine the effect of an epidemic. Neither the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus ([H1N1]pdm09) pandemic or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics had the combination of both high transmissibility and severity.

R0, the basic reproduction number, is a commonly used measure of transmissibility and is defined as the number of additional persons one case infects over the course of their illness. An R0 of less than 1 indicates the infection will die out “eventually.” An R0 of greater than 1 indicates the infection has the potential for sustained transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, first identified in southern California on April 15, 2009, was highly transmissible. By May 5, 2009, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 had spread to 41 US states and 21 countries.1 While influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was highly transmissible, it was not severe. Initial estimates of the R0 of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were 1.7.2 Although an estimated 201 200 respiratory deaths due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 occurred during the first year of the pandemic, the number of deaths per population was 30 times lower than that seen during the 1968 influenza pandemic, 1000 times less than the 1918 pandemic, and even less than typical seasonal influenza epidemics (estimated by the World Health Organization [WHO] to be 250 000 to 500 000 per year, although estimation methods differ).3 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was highly transmissible but not severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV (2012-current) cause severe disease, but despite the initial R0 estimations of greater than 2.0 for SARS-CoV (indicating sustained and even worldwide transmission could occur), and some large outbreaks, neither were as transmissible as initial concerns suggested. SARS-CoV caused 8098 reported cases and 774 deaths (case-fatality rate, 9.6%) in 37 countries before the epidemic was controlled. Control was thought to have been possible because a high proportion of cases were severe, making it easier to rapidly identify and isolate infected individuals. In addition, the virus was present at lower levels in upper airway secretions. There was no secondary transmission in the United States from the 8 imported cases, although in Toronto, Canada, a single importation is thought to have led to about 400 cases and 44 deaths. Later estimates of R0 were less than 1, indicating that SARS-CoV may not have been capable of sustained transmission, especially in the setting of control measures.4\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, MERS-CoV appears to have high severity and low transmissibility. Since 2012, MERS-CoV has caused 2494 reported cases and 858 deaths (case-fatality rate, 34%) in 27 countries. MERS-CoV has also caused some rapid outbreaks, mainly in hospitals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and South Korea, but estimates of MERS-CoV R0 are less than 1, and thus far it has been contained.5\n",
      "\n",
      "Can a respiratory virus that is both transmissible and severe be contained? In preparation for an influenza pandemic, the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Pandemic Influenza Plan included a combination of nonpharmaceutical (border and school closing, infection control measures) and pharmaceutical (antiviral prophylaxis, vaccines) interventions meant to be used in combination to interrupt or slow influenza transmission. Despite implementation of some of these interventions, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 spread to 120 countries in 3 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East, a preparedness plan was developed that included a surveillance plan, laboratory testing, and contact tracing guidance. Infection control guidance was developed for use in health care settings and traveler guidance was developed for the public.6 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction test kits to state health departments. Two cases were imported into the United States. Contacts were traced, including household, hospital, and airline contacts. No secondary cases were identified in the United States. MERS-CoV was thought to be severe and control measures relied on recognition of suspect cases. However, during a hospital outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, among hospitalized patients only 5 of 53 (9%) health care–associated cases had documented presence in the same room as a patient with MERS.5 Despite the high case-fatality rate (an important measure of severity), MERS cases can be asymptomatic and mild (25% in one outbreak). Although it is not known how often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients transmit MERS, initiating comprehensive measures such as isolating patients suspected of having or having been exposed to the virus and using personal protective equipment when caring for them may be extremely difficult because so many patients have mild and nonspecific symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the world ready for a respiratory virus with high transmissibility and severity? After a new influenza virus (H7N9) was identified in China in 2013, a series of modeling articles described the effect of, and level of preparedness for, a severe, single-wave pandemic in the United States.7 In scenarios that used clinical attack rates (the proportion of individuals who become ill with or die from a disease in a population initially uninfected) of 20% to 30% (for comparison the clinical attack rate was 20% in the first year of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic), depending on severity there would be an estimated 669 000 to 4.3 million hospitalizations and an estimated 54 000 to 538 000 deaths without any interventions in the United States. The models suggested that without a vaccine, school closures would be unlikely to affect the pandemic, an estimated 35 000 to 60 000 ventilators would be needed, up to an estimated 7.3 billion surgical masks or respirators would be required, and perhaps most important, if vaccine development did not start before the virus was introduced, it was unlikely that a significant number of hospitalizations and deaths could be averted due to the time it takes to develop, test, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible to know what will happen so early in this novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The scope, morbidity, and mortality will depend on the combination of severity and transmissibility. Numerous experts have “nowcasted” how many cases have occurred and forecasted how many cases will likely occur. A recent study suggests rapid person to person transmission can occur.8 Disease modelers have estimated R0 to be 2.2.9 The University of Hong Kong estimates the outbreak could infect more than 150 000 persons per day in China at its peak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is 2019-nCoV infection severe? To date approximately 14% of cases of 2019-nCoV have been described as severe by WHO, with a case-fatality rate of 2.1%.10 Estimates of severity are usually higher in the beginning of an epidemic due to the identification of the most severely affected cases and decline as the epidemic progresses. However, because many infected persons have not yet recovered and may still die, the case-fatality rate and severity could be underestimated. On January 30, 2020, WHO officially declared the 2019-nCoV epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, indicating its concern that countries aside from China could be affected by 2019-nCoV.\n",
      "\n",
      "In preparing for possible sustained transmission of 2019-nCoV beyond China, applicable lessons from previous experiences with epidemics/pandemics of respiratory viruses should be carefully considered to better control and mitigate potential consequences. Influenza preparedness plans have been developed that aim to stop, slow, or limit the spread of an influenza pandemic to the United States. These plans address limiting domestic spread and mitigating disease but also sustaining infrastructure and reducing the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy and society. These plans would be useful to enact during the 2019-nCoV epidemic should the United States experience sustained transmission. Countries have been successful in the past and there is nothing yet to predict that this time it is likely to be worse. Effective prevention and control will not be easy if there is sustained transmission and will require the full attention of public health, federal and local governments, the private sector, and every citizen.\n",

      "The message, that we need to prepare for a pandemic is vital. But the article misreports some key ideas. Firstly, SARS was not controlled \"because a high proportion of cases were severe.\" While that helped , it was because cases were not infectious before some days after symptom onset (usually in the second week of illness). This gave more time for case identification and isolation. And most cases did not pass on infection to anybody, but a few spread to many. When all such individuals were identified and isolated, spread stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the new virusappears to be spreading from people much earlier in the course of illness, and even with mild symptoms - which was never documented for SARS. However, it is not clear that it is any different or better at spread between people, and perhaps with the same pattern of most cases not causing further spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the R0, the basic reproduction number, is correctly described as the average number of infections each case causes. But it lacks two key ideas: 1) the 0 after the R implies the native state, which is a fully susceptible population and without any control measures. R is the effectiive number and can include the impact of control measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To claim that it was the lack of transmissibility, rather than the control measures that ended SARS, is not based on any evidence. And it ignores the heroic efforts of affected countries.\n",

      "In the winter season there comes the time of upper and lower respiratory tract infections characterised by cough, dyspnea and eventually fever (influenza-like illness).Some of the patients, especially older people living alone affected by the disease ,may need hospitalization and eventually intensive care. In many of the cases who are hospitalized nasal and/or tracheal fluid are examined for viral or bacterial agents. Only in less than 50% of the cases influenza viruses are considered to be the cause of the disease.In the rest of the cases diagnostic procedure for human coronaviruses is not performed routinely. One of the fourdifferent Human Coronaviruses (HuCoV: 229E,NL 63,0C43 and HKU1) can however be found in up to 30% ofpatients negative for influenza viruses (1). Chinese scientists in Wuhan, who had to deal with an increasing number of acute respiratory tract diseases resembling viral pneumonia, performed deep sequencing analysis from samples taken from the lower respiratory tract and found a \"novel\" coronavirus. The sequence of the complete genome was made public. At the same time, however, the notice from Wuhan brought to mind the SARS- and MERS-epidemics. The measures taken by the Chinese- and WHO-authorities are now well known.\n",

      "Recently about 150 new cases have been identified in northern Italy and health authorities are still looking for case 0 (the source). Is it possible that COVID-19 was already existent in Italy -- and not only in Italy but possibly everywhere in the world -- and that newly available nucleotide sequence allows now to find the cause of previously undefined influenza-like illness?\n",

      "Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-Z) and its spread outside of China, Europe\n",
      "is now experiencing large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented\n",
      "unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and\n",

      "In this report, we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the\n",
      "reproduction number across countries and over time. This allows us to leverage a greater amount of\n",
      "data across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that our results are driven strongly by the\n",
      "data from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain.\n",
      "We find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in Italy is consistent with a significant impact\n",

      "social distancing (such as banning large gatherings and advising individuals not to socialize outside\n",

      "in numbers of deaths to assess the extent to which transmission is being reduced. Representing the\n",
      "COVlD-19 infection process using a semi-mechanistic, joint, Bayesian hierarchical model, we can\n",
      "reproduce trends observed in the data on deaths and can forecast accurately over short time horizons.\n",
      "\n",
      "We estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. The high level\n",
      "of under-ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in\n",
      "hospital settings rather than in the community. Despite this, only a small minority of individuals in\n",
      "each country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 4.9% [l.9%-ll%] with considerable\n",
      "variation between countries (Table 1). Our estimates imply that the populations in Europe are not\n",
      "close to herd immunity (\"50-75% if R0 is 2-4). Further, with Rt values dropping substantially, the rate\n",
      "of acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. This implies that the virus will be able to spread\n",
      "rapidly should interventions be lifted. Such estimates of the attack rate to date urgently need to be\n",
      "validated by newly developed antibody tests in representative population surveys, once these become\n",
      "available.\n",
      "\n",
      "We estimate that major non-pharmaceutical interventions have had a substantial impact on the time-\n",
      "varying reproduction numbers in countries where there has been time to observe intervention effects\n",
      "on trends in deaths (Italy, Spain). lfadherence in those countries has changed since that initial period,\n",
      "then our forecast of future deaths will be affected accordingly: increasing adherence over time will\n",
      "have resulted in fewer deaths and decreasing adherence in more deaths. Similarly, our estimates of\n",
      "the impact ofinterventions in other countries should be viewed with caution if the same interventions\n",
      "have achieved different levels of adherence than was initially the case in Italy and Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the implementation of interventions in rapid succession in many countries, there are not\n",
      "enough data to estimate the individual effect size of each intervention, and we discourage attributing\n",
      "\n",
      "associations to individual intervention. In some cases, such as Norway, where all interventions were\n",
      "implemented at once, these individual effects are by definition unidentifiable. Despite this, while\n",
      "individual impacts cannot be determined, their estimated joint impact is strongly empirically justified\n",
      "(see Appendix 8.4 for sensitivity analysis). While the growth in daily deaths has decreased, due to the\n",
      "lag between infections and deaths, continued rises in daily deaths are to be expected for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the impact of interventions, we fit a counterfactual model without the interventions\n",
      "and compare this to the actual model. Consider Italy and the UK - two countries at very different stages\n",
      "in their epidemics. For the UK, where interventions are very recent, much of the intervention strength\n",
      "is borrowed from countries with older epidemics. The results suggest that interventions will have a\n",

      "\n",
      "The counterfactual model for Italy suggests that despite mounting pressure on health systems,\n",

      "3 days and looking over the whole epidemic the number of deaths averted is substantial. We note that\n",
      "substantial innovation is taking place, and new more effective interventions or refinements of current\n",
      "interventions, alongside behavioral changes will further contribute to reductions in infections. We\n",
      "cannot say for certain that the current measures have controlled the epidemic in Europe; however, if\n",
      "current trends continue, there is reason for optimism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach is semi-mechanistic. We propose a plausible structure for the infection process and then\n",
      "estimate parameters empirically. However, many parameters had to be given strong prior\n",
      "distributions or had to be fixed. For these assumptions, we have provided relevant citations to\n",
      "previous studies. As more data become available and better estimates arise, we will update these in\n",

      "influence the rate of death and hence the estimated number of true underlying cases.\n",

In response, many European countries have implemented\\nunprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and\\nuniversities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social\\ndistancing including local and national Iockdowns.\\n\\nIn this report, we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact\\nof these interventions across 11 European countries. Our methods assume that changes in the\\nreproductive number— a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions\\nbeing implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these\\nchanges by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that\\noccurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death.\\n\\nOne of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the\\nreproduction number across countries and over time. This allows us to leverage a greater amount of\\ndata across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that our results are driven strongly by the\\ndata from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain.\\nWe find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in Italy is consistent with a significant impact\\nof interventions implemented several weeks earlier. In Italy, we estimate that the effective\\nreproduction number, Rt, dropped to close to 1 around the time of Iockdown (11th March), although\\nwith a high level of uncertainty.\\n\\nOverall, we estimate that countries have managed to reduce their reproduction number. Our\\nestimates have wide credible intervals and contain 1 for countries that have implemented a||\\ninterventions considered in our analysis. This means that the reproduction number may be above or\\nbelow this value. With current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of March, we\\nestimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March\\n[95% credible interval 21,000-120,000]. Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that\\ninterventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. We estimate that, across all 11\\ncountries between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-Z up to 28th March,\\nrepresenting between 1.88% and 11.43% ofthe population. The proportion of the population infected\\n\\nto date — the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in Spain followed by Italy and lowest in Germany\\nand Norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics.\\n\\nGiven the lag of 2-3 weeks between when transmission changes occur and when their impact can be\\nobserved in trends in mortality, for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be\\ncertain that recent interventions have been effective. If interventions in countries at earlier stages of\\ntheir epidemic, such as Germany or the UK, are more or less effective than they were in the countries\\nwith advanced epidemics, on which our estimates are largely based, or if interventions have improved\\nor worsened over time, then our estimates of the reproduction number and deaths averted would\\nchange accordingly. It is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in\\ncases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that\\ntransmission of SARS-Cov-Z is slowing.\\n\\nSUGGESTED CITATION\\n\\nSeth Flaxman, Swapnil Mishra, Axel Gandy et 0/. Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non—\\npharmaceutical interventions on COVID—19 in 11 European countries. Imperial College London (2020), doi:\\nhttps://doi.org/10.25561/77731\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nFollowing the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-Z) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and\\nits global spread, large epidemics of the disease, caused by the virus designated COVID-19, have\\nemerged in Europe. In response to the rising numbers of cases and deaths, and to maintain the\\ncapacity of health systems to treat as many severe cases as possible, European countries, like those in\\nother continents, have implemented or are in the process of implementing measures to control their\\nepidemics. These large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions vary between countries but include\\nsocial distancing (such as banning large gatherings and advising individuals not to socialize outside\\ntheir households), border closures, school closures, measures to isolate symptomatic individuals and\\ntheir contacts, and large-scale lockdowns of populations with all but essential internal travel banned.\\nUnderstanding firstly, whether these interventions are having the desired impact of controlling the\\nepidemic and secondly, which interventions are necessary to maintain control, is critical given their\\nlarge economic and social costs.\\n\\nThe key aim ofthese interventions is to reduce the effective reproduction number, Rt, ofthe infection,\\na fundamental epidemiological quantity representing the average number of infections, at time t, per\\ninfected case over the course of their infection. Ith is maintained at less than 1, the incidence of new\\ninfections decreases, ultimately resulting in control of the epidemic. If Rt is greater than 1, then\\ninfections will increase (dependent on how much greater than 1 the reproduction number is) until the\\nepidemic peaks and eventually declines due to acquisition of herd immunity.\\n\\nIn China, strict movement restrictions and other measures including case isolation and quarantine\\nbegan to be introduced from 23rd January, which achieved a downward trend in the number of\\nconfirmed new cases during February, resulting in zero new confirmed indigenous cases in Wuhan by\\nMarch 19th. Studies have estimated how Rt changed during this time in different areas ofChina from\\naround 2-4 during the uncontrolled epidemic down to below 1, with an estimated 7-9 fold decrease\\nin the number of daily contacts per person.1\\'2 Control measures such as social distancing, intensive\\ntesting, and contact tracing in other countries such as Singapore and South Korea have successfully\\nreduced case incidence in recent weeks, although there is a riskthe virus will spread again once control\\nmeasures are relaxed.3\\'4\\n\\nThe epidemic began slightly laterin Europe, from January or later in different regions.5 Countries have\\nimplemented different combinations of control measures and the level of adherence to government\\nrecommendations on social distancing is likely to vary between countries, in part due to different\\nlevels of enforcement.\\n\\nEstimating reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-Z presents challenges due to the high proportion of\\ninfections not detected by health systems”7 and regular changes in testing policies, resulting in\\ndifferent proportions of infections being detected over time and between countries. Most countries\\nso far only have the capacity to test a small proportion of suspected cases and tests are reserved for\\nseverely ill patients or for high-risk groups (e.g. contacts of cases). Looking at case data, therefore,\\ngives a systematically biased view of trends.\\n\\nAn alternative way to estimate the course of the epidemic is to back-calculate infections from\\nobserved deaths. Reported deaths are likely to be more reliable, although the early focus of most\\nsurveillance systems on cases with reported travel histories to China may mean that some early deaths\\nwill have been missed. Whilst the recent trends in deaths will therefore be informative, there is a time\\nlag in observing the effect of interventions on deaths since there is a 2-3-week period between\\ninfection, onset of symptoms and outcome.\\n\\nIn this report, we fit a novel Bayesian mechanistic model of the infection cycle to observed deaths in\\n11 European countries, inferring plausible upper and lower bounds (Bayesian credible intervals) of the\\ntotal populations infected (attack rates), case detection probabilities, and the reproduction number\\nover time (Rt). We fit the model jointly to COVID-19 data from all these countries to assess whether\\nthere is evidence that interventions have so far been successful at reducing Rt below 1, with the strong\\nassumption that particular interventions are achieving a similar impact in different countries and that\\nthe efficacy of those interventions remains constant over time. The model is informed more strongly\\nby countries with larger numbers of deaths and which implemented interventions earlier, therefore\\nestimates of recent Rt in countries with more recent interventions are contingent on similar\\nintervention impacts. Data in the coming weeks will enable estimation of country-specific Rt with\\ngreater precision.\\n\\nModel and data details are presented in the appendix, validation and sensitivity are also presented in\\nthe appendix, and general limitations presented below in the conclusions.\\n\\n2 Results\\n\\nThe timing of interventions should be taken in the context of when an individual country’s epidemic\\nstarted to grow along with the speed with which control measures were implemented. Italy was the\\nfirst to begin intervention measures, and other countries followed soon afterwards (Figure 1). Most\\ninterventions began around 12th-14th March. We analyzed data on deaths up to 28th March, giving a\\n2-3-week window over which to estimate the effect of interventions. Currently, most countries in our\\nstudy have implemented all major non-pharmaceutical interventions.\\n\\nFor each country, we model the number of infections, the number of deaths, and Rt, the effective\\nreproduction number over time, with Rt changing only when an intervention is introduced (Figure 2-\\n12). Rt is the average number of secondary infections per infected individual, assuming that the\\ninterventions that are in place at time t stay in place throughout their entire infectious period. Every\\ncountry has its own individual starting reproduction number Rt before interventions take place.\\nSpecific interventions are assumed to have the same relative impact on Rt in each country when they\\nwere introduced there and are informed by mortality data across all countries.\\n\\n\\nFigure l: Intervention timings for the 11 European countries included in the analysis. For further\\ndetails see Appendix 8.6.\\n\\n2.1 Estimated true numbers of infections and current attack rates\\n\\nIn all countries, we estimate there are orders of magnitude fewer infections detected (Figure 2) than\\ntrue infections, mostly likely due to mild and asymptomatic infections as well as limited testing\\ncapacity. In Italy, our results suggest that, cumulatively, 5.9 [1.9-15.2] million people have been\\ninfected as of March 28th, giving an attack rate of 9.8% [3.2%-25%] of the population (Table 1). Spain\\nhas recently seen a large increase in the number of deaths, and given its smaller population, our model\\nestimates that a higher proportion of the population, 15.0% (7.0 [18-19] million people) have been\\ninfected to date. Germany is estimated to have one of the lowest attack rates at 0.7% with 600,000\\n[240,000-1,500,000] people infected.\\n\\nImperial College COVID-19 Response Team\\n\\nTable l: Posterior model estimates of percentage of total population infected as of 28th March 2020.\\n\\nCountry % of total population infected (mean [95% credible intervall)\\nAustria 1.1% [0.36%-3.1%]\\nBelgium 3.7% [1.3%-9.7%]\\nDenmark 1.1% [0.40%-3.1%]\\nFrance 3.0% [1.1%-7.4%]\\nGermany 0.72% [0.28%-1.8%]\\nItaly 9.8% [3.2%-26%]\\nNorway 0.41% [0.09%-1.2%]\\nSpain 15% [3.7%-41%]\\nSweden 3.1% [0.85%-8.4%]\\nSwitzerland 3.2% [1.3%-7.6%]\\nUnited Kingdom 2.7% [1.2%-5.4%]\\n\\n2.2 Reproduction numbers and impact of interventions\\n\\nAveraged across all countries, we estimate initial reproduction numbers of around 3.87 [3.01-4.66],\\nwhich is in line with other estimates.1\\'8 These estimates are informed by our choice of serial interval\\ndistribution and the initial growth rate of observed deaths. A shorter assumed serial interval results in\\nlower starting reproduction numbers (Appendix 8.4.2, Appendix 8.4.6). The initial reproduction\\nnumbers are also uncertain due to (a) importation being the dominant source of new infections early\\nin the epidemic, rather than local transmission (b) possible under-ascertainment in deaths particularly\\nbefore testing became widespread.\\n\\nWe estimate large changes in Rt in response to the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our\\nresults, which are driven largely by countries with advanced epidemics and larger numbers of deaths\\n(e.g. Italy, Spain), suggest that these interventions have together had a substantial impact on\\ntransmission, as measured by changes in the estimated reproduction number Rt. Across all countries\\nwe find current estimates of Rt to range from a posterior mean of 0.97 [0.14-2.14] for Norway to a\\nposterior mean of2.64 [1.40-4.18] for Sweden, with an average of 1.43 across the 11 country posterior\\nmeans, a 64% reduction compared to the pre-intervention values. We note that these estimates are\\ncontingent on intervention impact being the same in different countries and at different times. In all\\ncountries but Sweden, under the same assumptions, we estimate that the current reproduction\\nnumber includes 1 in the uncertainty range. The estimated reproduction number for Sweden is higher,\\nnot because the mortality trends are significantly different from any other country, but as an artefact\\nof our model, which assumes a smaller reduction in Rt because no full lockdown has been ordered so\\nfar. Overall, we cannot yet conclude whether current interventions are sufficient to drive Rt below 1\\n(posterior probability of being less than 1.0 is 44% on average across the countries). We are also\\nunable to conclude whether interventions may be different between countries or over time.\\n\\nThere remains a high level of uncertainty in these estimates. It is too early to detect substantial\\nintervention impact in many countries at earlier stages of their epidemic (e.g. Germany, UK, Norway).\\nMany interventions have occurred only recently, and their effects have not yet been fully observed\\ndue to the time lag between infection and death. This uncertainty will reduce as more data become\\navailable. For all countries, our model fits observed deaths data well (Bayesian goodness of fit tests).\\nWe also found that our model can reliably forecast daily deaths 3 days into the future, by withholding\\nthe latest 3 days of data and comparing model predictions to observed deaths (Appendix 8.3).\\n\\nThe close spacing of interventions in time made it statistically impossible to determine which had the\\ngreatest effect (Figure 1, Figure 4). However, when doing a sensitivity analysis (Appendix 8.4.3) with\\nuninformative prior distributions (where interventions can increase deaths) we find similar impact of\\n\\nImperial College COVID-19 Response Team\\n\\ninterventions, which shows that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in the\\n\\nmain analysis.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Country-level estimates of infections, deaths and Rt. Left: daily number of infections, brown\\nbars are reported infections, blue bands are predicted infections, dark blue 50% credible interval (CI),\\nlight blue 95% CI. The number of daily infections estimated by our model drops immediately after an\\nintervention, as we assume that all infected people become immediately less infectious through the\\nintervention.

Again, the assumption in these predictions is that intervention\\nimpact is the same across countries and time. The model without interventions was unable to capture\\nrecent trends in deaths in several countries, where the rate of increase had clearly slowed (Figure 3).\\nTrends were confirmed statistically by Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation and the widely\\napplicable information criterion assessments —WA|C).\\n\\nBy comparing the deaths predicted under the model with no interventions to the deaths predicted in\\nour intervention model, we calculated the total deaths averted up to the end of March. We find that,\\nacross 11 countries, since the beginning of the epidemic, 59,000 [21,000-120,000] deaths have been\\naverted due to interventions. In Italy and Spain, where the epidemic is advanced, 38,000 [13,000-\\n84,000] and 16,000 [5,400-35,000] deaths have been averted, respectively. Even in the UK, which is\\nmuch earlier in its epidemic, we predict 370 [73-1,000] deaths have been averted.\\n\\nThese numbers give only the deaths averted that would have occurred up to 31 March. lfwe were to\\ninclude the deaths of currently infected individuals in both models, which might happen after 31\\nMarch, then the deaths averted would be substantially higher.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Daily number of confirmed deaths, predictions (up to 28 March) and forecasts (after) for (a)\\nItaly and (b) Spain from our model with interventions (blue) and from the no interventions\\ncounterfactual model (pink); credible intervals are shown one week into the future.

Mean relative percentage reduction in Rt is shown\\nwith 95% posterior credible intervals. If 100% reduction is achieved, Rt = 0 and there is no more\\ntransmission of COVID-19. No effects are significantly different from any others, probably due to the\\nfact that many interventions occurred on the same day or within days of each other as shown in\\nFigure l.\\n\\n3 Discussion\\n\\nDuring this early phase of control measures against the novel coronavirus in Europe, we analyze trends\\nin numbers of deaths to assess the extent to which transmission is being reduced. Representing the\\nCOVlD-19 infection process using a semi-mechanistic, joint, Bayesian hierarchical model, we can\\nreproduce trends observed in the data on deaths and can forecast accurately over short time horizons.\\n\\nWe estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. The high level\\nof under-ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in\\nhospital settings rather than in the community. Despite this, only a small minority of individuals in\\neach country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 4.9% [l.9%-ll%] with considerable\\nvariation between countries (Table 1). Our estimates imply that the populations in Europe are not\\nclose to herd immunity (\"50-75% if R0 is 2-4). Further, with Rt values dropping substantially, the rate\\nof acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. This implies that the virus will be able to spread\\nrapidly should interventions be lifted. Such estimates of the attack rate to date urgently need to be\\nvalidated by newly developed antibody tests in representative population surveys, once these become\\navailable.\\n\\nWe estimate that major non-pharmaceutical interventions have had a substantial impact on the time-\\nvarying reproduction numbers in countries where there has been time to observe intervention effects\\non trends in deaths (Italy, Spain). lfadherence in those countries has changed since that initial period,\\nthen our forecast of future deaths will be affected accordingly: increasing adherence over time will\\nhave resulted in fewer deaths and decreasing adherence in more deaths. Similarly, our estimates of\\nthe impact ofinterventions in other countries should be viewed with caution if the same interventions\\nhave achieved different levels of adherence than was initially the case in Italy and Spain.\\n\\nDue to the implementation of interventions in rapid succession in many countries, there are not\\nenough data to estimate the individual effect size of each intervention, and we discourage attributing\\n\\nassociations to individual intervention. In some cases, such as Norway, where all interventions were\\nimplemented at once, these individual effects are by definition unidentifiable. Despite this, while\\nindividual impacts cannot be determined, their estimated joint impact is strongly empirically justified\\n(see Appendix 8.4 for sensitivity analysis). While the growth in daily deaths has decreased, due to the\\nlag between infections and deaths, continued rises in daily deaths are to be expected for some time.\\n\\nTo understand the impact of interventions, we fit a counterfactual model without the interventions\\nand compare this to the actual model. Consider Italy and the UK - two countries at very different stages\\nin their epidemics. For the UK, where interventions are very recent, much of the intervention strength\\nis borrowed from countries with older epidemics. The results suggest that interventions will have a\\nlarge impact on infections and deaths despite counts of both rising. For Italy, where far more time has\\npassed since the interventions have been implemented, it is clear that the model without\\ninterventions does not fit well to the data, and cannot explain the sub-linear (on the logarithmic scale)\\nreduction in deaths (see Figure 10).\\n\\nThe counterfactual model for Italy suggests that despite mounting pressure on health systems,\\ninterventions have averted a health care catastrophe where the number of new deaths would have\\nbeen 3.7 times higher (38,000 deaths averted) than currently observed. Even in the UK, much earlier\\nin its epidemic, the recent interventions are forecasted to avert 370 total deaths up to 31 of March.\\n\\n4 Conclusion and Limitations\\n\\nModern understanding of infectious disease with a global publicized response has meant that\\nnationwide interventions could be implemented with widespread adherence and support. Given\\nobserved infection fatality ratios and the epidemiology of COVlD-19, major non-pharmaceutical\\ninterventions have had a substantial impact in reducing transmission in countries with more advanced\\nepidemics. It is too early to be sure whether similar reductions will be seen in countries at earlier\\nstages of their epidemic. While we cannot determine which set of interventions have been most\\nsuccessful, taken together, we can already see changes in the trends of new deaths. When forecasting\\n3 days and looking over the whole epidemic the number of deaths averted is substantial. We note that\\nsubstantial innovation is taking place, and new more effective interventions or refinements of current\\ninterventions, alongside behavioral changes will further contribute to reductions in infections. We\\ncannot say for certain that the current measures have controlled the epidemic in Europe; however, if\\ncurrent trends continue, there is reason for optimism.\\n\\nOur approach is semi-mechanistic. We propose a plausible structure for the infection process and then\\nestimate parameters empirically. However, many parameters had to be given strong prior\\ndistributions or had to be fixed. For these assumptions, we have provided relevant citations to\\nprevious studies. As more data become available and better estimates arise, we will update these in\\nweekly reports. Our choice of serial interval distribution strongly influences the prior distribution for\\nstarting R0. Our infection fatality ratio, and infection-to-onset-to-death distributions strongly\\ninfluence the rate of death and hence the estimated number of true underlying cases.\\n\\nWe also assume that the effect of interventions is the same in all countries, which may not be fully\\nrealistic. This assumption implies that countries with early interventions and more deaths since these\\ninterventions (e.g. Italy, Spain) strongly influence estimates of intervention impact in countries at\\nearlier stages of their epidemic with fewer deaths (e.g. Germany, UK).\\n\\nWe have tried to create consistent definitions of all interventions and document details of this in\\nAppendix 8.6. However, invariably there will be differences from country to country in the strength of\\ntheir intervention — for example, most countries have banned gatherings of more than 2 people when\\nimplementing a lockdown, whereas in Sweden the government only banned gatherings of more than\\n10 people. These differences can skew impacts in countries with very little data. We believe that our\\nuncertainty to some degree can cover these differences, and as more data become available,\\ncoefficients should become more reliable.\\n\\nHowever, despite these strong assumptions, there is sufficient signal in the data to estimate changes\\nin R, (see the sensitivity analysis reported in Appendix 8.4.3) and this signal will stand to increase with\\ntime. In our Bayesian hierarchical framework, we robustly quantify the uncertainty in our parameter\\nestimates and posterior predictions. This can be seen in the very wide credible intervals in more recent\\ndays, where little or no death data are available to inform the estimates. Furthermore, we predict\\nintervention impact at country-level, but different trends may be in place in different parts of each\\ncountry. For example, the epidemic in northern Italy was subject to controls earlier than the rest of\\nthe country.\\n\\n5 Data\\n\\nOur model utilizes daily real-time death data from the ECDC (European Centre of Disease Control),\\nwhere we catalogue case data for 11 European countries currently experiencing the epidemic: Austria,\\nBelgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United\\nKingdom. The ECDC provides information on confirmed cases and deaths attributable to COVID-19.\\nHowever, the case data are highly unrepresentative of the incidence of infections due to\\nunderreporting as well as systematic and country-specific changes in testing.\\n\\nWe, therefore, use only deaths attributable to COVID-19 in our model; we do not use the ECDC case\\nestimates at all. While the observed deaths still have some degree of unreliability, again due to\\nchanges in reporting and testing, we believe the data are ofsufficient fidelity to model. For population\\ncounts, we use UNPOP age-stratified counts.10\\n\\nWe also catalogue data on the nature and type of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. We looked\\nat the government webpages from each country as well as their official public health\\ndivision/information webpages to identify the latest advice/laws being issued by the government and\\npublic health authorities. We collected the following:\\n\\nSchool closure ordered: This intervention refers to nationwide extraordinary school closures which in\\nmost cases refer to both primary and secondary schools closing (for most countries this also includes\\nthe closure of otherforms of higher education or the advice to teach remotely). In the case of Denmark\\nand Sweden, we allowed partial school closures of only secondary schools. The date of the school\\nclosure is taken to be the effective date when the schools started to be closed (ifthis was on a Monday,\\nthe date used was the one of the previous Saturdays as pupils and students effectively stayed at home\\nfrom that date onwards).\\n\\nCase-based measures: This intervention comprises strong recommendations or laws to the general\\npublic and primary care about self—isolation when showing COVID-19-like symptoms. These also\\ninclude nationwide testing programs where individuals can be tested and subsequently self—isolated.\\nOur definition is restricted to nationwide government advice to all individuals (e.g. UK) or to all primary\\ncare and excludes regional only advice. These do not include containment phase interventions such\\nas isolation if travelling back from an epidemic country such as China.\\n\\nPublic events banned: This refers to banning all public events of more than 100 participants such as\\nsports events.\\n\\nSocial distancing encouraged: As one of the first interventions against the spread of the COVID-19\\npandemic, many governments have published advice on social distancing including the\\nrecommendation to work from home wherever possible, reducing use ofpublictransport and all other\\nnon-essential contact. The dates used are those when social distancing has officially been\\nrecommended by the government; the advice may include maintaining a recommended physical\\ndistance from others.\\n\\nLockdown decreed: There are several different scenarios that the media refers to as lockdown. As an\\noverall definition, we consider regulations/legislations regarding strict face-to-face social interaction:\\nincluding the banning of any non-essential public gatherings, closure of educational and\\n\\npublic/cultural institutions, ordering people to stay home apart from exercise and essential tasks. We\\ninclude special cases where these are not explicitly mentioned on government websites but are\\nenforced by the police (e.g. France). The dates used are the effective dates when these legislations\\nhave been implemented. We note that lockdown encompasses other interventions previously\\nimplemented.\\n\\nFirst intervention: As Figure 1 shows, European governments have escalated interventions rapidly,\\nand in some examples (Norway/Denmark) have implemented these interventions all on a single day.\\nTherefore, given the temporal autocorrelation inherent in government intervention, we include a\\nbinary covariate for the first intervention, which can be interpreted as a government decision to take\\nmajor action to control COVID-19.\\n\\nA full list of the timing of these interventions and the sources we have used can be found in Appendix\\n8.6.\\n\\n6 Methods Summary\\n\\nA Visual summary of our model is presented in Figure 5 (details in Appendix 8.1 and 8.2). Replication\\ncode is available at https://github.com/|mperia|CollegeLondon/covid19model/releases/tag/vl.0\\n\\nWe fit our model to observed deaths according to ECDC data from 11 European countries. The\\nmodelled deaths are informed by an infection-to-onset distribution (time from infection to the onset\\nof symptoms), an onset-to-death distribution (time from the onset of symptoms to death), and the\\npopulation-averaged infection fatality ratio (adjusted for the age structure and contact patterns of\\neach country, see Appendix). Given these distributions and ratios, modelled deaths are a function of\\nthe number of infections. The modelled number of infections is informed by the serial interval\\ndistribution (the average time from infection of one person to the time at which they infect another)\\nand the time-varying reproduction number. Finally, the time-varying reproduction number is a\\nfunction of the initial reproduction number before interventions and the effect sizes from\\ninterventions. \\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Summary of model components.\\n\\nFollowing the hierarchy from bottom to top gives us a full framework to see how interventions affect\\ninfections, which can result in deaths. We use Bayesian inference to ensure our modelled deaths can\\nreproduce the observed deaths as closely as possible. From bottom to top in Figure 5, there is an\\nimplicit lag in time that means the effect of very recent interventions manifest weakly in current\\ndeaths (and get stronger as time progresses). To maximise the ability to observe intervention impact\\non deaths, we fit our model jointly for all 11 European countries, which results in a large data set. Our\\nmodel jointly estimates the effect sizes of interventions. We have evaluated the effect ofour Bayesian\\nprior distribution choices and evaluate our Bayesian posterior calibration to ensure our results are\\nstatistically robust (Appendix 8.4).\\n\\n7 Acknowledgements\\n\\nInitial research on covariates in Appendix 8.6 was crowdsourced; we thank a number of people\\nacross the world for help with this.

These daily deaths are\\nmodelled using a positive real-Valued function dam = E(Dam) that represents the expected number\\nof deaths attributed to COVID-19. Dam is assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution with\\n\\n\\nThe expected number of deaths (1 in a given country on a given day is a function of the number of\\ninfections C occurring in previous days.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the epidemic, the observed deaths in a country can be dominated by deaths that\\nresult from infection that are not locally acquired. To avoid biasing our model by this, we only include\\nobserved deaths from the day after a country has cumulatively observed 10 deaths in our model.\\n\\nTo mechanistically link ourfunction for deaths to infected cases, we use a previously estimated COVID-\\n19 infection-fatality-ratio ifr (probability of death given infection)9 together with a distribution oftimes\\nfrom infection to death TE. The ifr is derived from estimates presented in Verity et al11 which assumed\\nhomogeneous attack rates across age-groups. To better match estimates of attack rates by age\\ngenerated using more detailed information on country and age-specific mixing patterns, we scale\\nthese estimates (the unadjusted ifr, referred to here as ifr’) in the following way as in previous work.4\\nLet Ca be the number of infections generated in age-group a, Na the underlying size of the population\\nin that age group and AR“ 2 Ca/Na the age-group-specific attack rate. The adjusted ifr is then given\\n\\nby: ifra = ﬁfiﬁé, where AR50_59 is the predicted attack-rate in the 50-59 year age-group after\\n\\nincorporating country-specific patterns of contact and mixing. This age-group was chosen as the\\nreference as it had the lowest predicted level of underreporting in previous analyses of data from the\\nChinese epidemic“. We obtained country-specific estimates of attack rate by age, AR“, for the 11\\nEuropean countries in our analysis from a previous study which incorporates information on contact\\nbetween individuals of different ages in countries across Europe.12 We then obtained overall ifr\\nestimates for each country adjusting for both demography and age-specific attack rates.\\n\\nUsing estimated epidemiological information from previous studies,“\\'11 we assume TE to be the sum of\\ntwo independent random times: the incubation period (infection to onset of symptoms or infection-\\nto-onset) distribution and the time between onset of symptoms and death (onset-to-death). The\\ninfection-to-onset distribution is Gamma distributed with mean 5.1 days and coefficient of variation\\n0.86. The onset-to-death distribution is also Gamma distributed with a mean of 18.8 days and a\\ncoefficient of va riation 0.45. ifrm is population averaged over the age structure of a given country. The\\ninfection-to-death distribution is therefore given by:\\n\\num ~ ifrm ~ (Gamma(5.1,0.86) + Gamma(18.8,0.45))\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the infection-to-death distribution and the resulting survival function that integrates\\nto the infection fatality ratio.\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Left, infection-to-death distribution (mean 23.9 days). Right, survival probability of infected\\nindividuals per day given the infection fatality ratio (1%) and the infection-to-death distribution on\\nthe left.\\n\\nUsing the probability of death distribution, the expected number of deaths dam, on a given day t, for\\ncountry, m, is given by the following discrete sum:\\n\\n\\nThe number of deaths today is the sum of the past infections weighted by their probability of death,\\nwhere the probability of death depends on the number of days since infection.\\n\\n8.2 Infection model\\n\\nThe true number of infected individuals, C, is modelled using a discrete renewal process. This approach\\nhas been used in numerous previous studies13\\'16 and has a strong theoretical basis in stochastic\\nindividual-based counting processes such as Hawkes process and the Bellman-Harris process.”18 The\\nrenewal model is related to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, except the renewal is not\\nexpressed in differential form. To model the number ofinfections over time we need to specify a serial\\ninterval distribution g with density g(T), (the time between when a person gets infected and when\\nthey subsequently infect another other people), which we choose to be Gamma distributed:\\n\\ng ~ Gamma (6.50.62).\\n\\nThe serial interval distribution is shown below in Figure 7 and is assumed to be the same for all\\ncountries.\\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 7: Serial interval distribution g with a mean of 6.5 days.\\n\\nGiven the serial interval distribution, the number of infections Eamon a given day t, and country, m,\\nis given by the following discrete convolution function:\\n\\n_ t—1\\nCam — Ram ZT=0 Cr,mgt—‘r r\\nwhere, similarto the probability ofdeath function, the daily serial interval is discretized by\\n\\nfs+0.5\\n\\n1.5\\ngs = T=s—0.Sg(T)dT fors = 2,3, and 91 = fT=Og(T)dT.\\n\\nInfections today depend on the number of infections in the previous days, weighted by the discretized\\nserial interval distribution. This weighting is then scaled by the country-specific time-Varying\\nreproduction number, Ram, that models the average number of secondary infections at a given time.\\n\\nThe functional form for the time-Varying reproduction number was chosen to be as simple as possible\\nto minimize the impact of strong prior assumptions: we use a piecewise constant function that scales\\nRam from a baseline prior R0,m and is driven by known major non-pharmaceutical interventions\\noccurring in different countries and times. We included 6 interventions, one of which is constructed\\nfrom the other 5 interventions, which are timings of school and university closures (k=l), self—isolating\\nif ill (k=2), banning of public events (k=3), any government intervention in place (k=4), implementing\\na partial or complete lockdown (k=5) and encouraging social distancing and isolation (k=6). We denote\\nthe indicator variable for intervention k E 1,2,3,4,5,6 by IkI’m, which is 1 if intervention k is in place\\nin country m at time t and 0 otherwise. The covariate ”any government intervention” (k=4) indicates\\nif any of the other 5 interventions are in effect,i.e.14’t’m equals 1 at time t if any of the interventions\\nk E 1,2,3,4,5 are in effect in country m at time t and equals 0 otherwise. Covariate 4 has the\\ninterpretation of indicating the onset of major government intervention. The effect of each\\nintervention is assumed to be multiplicative. Ram is therefore a function ofthe intervention indicators\\nIk’t’m in place at time t in country m:\\n\\nRam : R0,m eXp(— 212:1 O(Rheum)-\\n\\nThe exponential form was used to ensure positivity of the reproduction number, with R0,m\\nconstrained to be positive as it appears outside the exponential. The impact of each intervention on\\n\\nRam is characterised by a set of parameters 0(1, ...,OL6, with independent prior distributions chosen\\nto be\\n\\nock ~ Gamma(. 5,1).\\n\\nThe impacts ock are shared between all m countries and therefore they are informed by all available\\ndata. The prior distribution for R0 was chosen to be\\n\\nR0,m ~ Normal(2.4, IKI) with K ~ Normal(0,0.5),\\nOnce again, K is the same among all countries to share information.\\n\\nWe assume that seeding of new infections begins 30 days before the day after a country has\\ncumulatively observed 10 deaths. From this date, we seed our model with 6 sequential days of\\ninfections drawn from cl’m,...,66’m~EXponential(T), where T~Exponential(0.03). These seed\\ninfections are inferred in our Bayesian posterior distribution.\\n\\nWe estimated parameters jointly for all 11 countries in a single hierarchical model. Fitting was done\\nin the probabilistic programming language Stan,19 using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)\\nsampler. We ran 8 chains for 4000 iterations with 2000 iterations of warmup and a thinning factor 4\\nto obtain 2000 posterior samples. Posterior convergence was assessed using the Rhat statistic and by\\ndiagnosing divergent transitions of the HMC sampler. Prior-posterior calibrations were also performed\\n(see below).\\n\\n8.3 Validation\\n\\nWe validate accuracy of point estimates of our model using cross-Validation. In our cross-validation\\nscheme, we leave out 3 days of known death data (non-cumulative) and fit our model. We forecast\\nwhat the model predicts for these three days. We present the individual forecasts for each day, as\\nwell as the average forecast for those three days. The cross-validation results are shown in the Figure\\n8.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Cross-Validation results for 3-day and 3-day aggregatedforecasts\\n\\nFigure 8 provides strong empirical justification for our model specification and mechanism. Our\\naccurate forecast over a three-day time horizon suggests that our fitted estimates for Rt are\\nappropriate and plausible.\\n\\nAlong with from point estimates we all evaluate our posterior credible intervals using the Rhat\\nstatistic. The Rhat statistic measures whether our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains have\\n\\nconverged to the equilibrium distribution (the correct posterior distribution). Figure 9 shows the Rhat\\nstatistics for all of our parameters\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: Rhat statistics - values close to 1 indicate MCMC convergence.\\n\\nFigure 9 indicates that our MCMC have converged. In fitting we also ensured that the MCMC sampler\\nexperienced no divergent transitions - suggesting non pathological posterior topologies.\\n\\n8.4 SensitivityAnalysis\\n\\n8.4.1 Forecasting on log-linear scale to assess signal in the data\\n\\nAs we have highlighted throughout in this report, the lag between deaths and infections means that\\nit ta kes time for information to propagate backwa rds from deaths to infections, and ultimately to Rt.\\nA conclusion of this report is the prediction of a slowing of Rt in response to major interventions. To\\ngain intuition that this is data driven and not simply a consequence of highly constrained model\\nassumptions, we show death forecasts on a log-linear scale. On this scale a line which curves below a\\nlinear trend is indicative of slowing in the growth of the epidemic. Figure 10 to Figure 12 show these\\nforecasts for Italy, Spain and the UK. They show this slowing down in the daily number of deaths. Our\\nmodel suggests that Italy, a country that has the highest death toll of COVID-19, will see a slowing in\\nthe increase in daily deaths over the coming week compared to the early stages of the epidemic.\\n\\n\\nWe investigated the sensitivity of our estimates of starting and final Rt to our assumed serial interval\\ndistribution. For this we considered several scenarios, in which we changed the serial interval\\ndistribution mean, from a value of 6.5 days, to have values of 5, 6, 7 and 8 days.\\n\\nIn Figure 13, we show our estimates of R0, the starting reproduction number before interventions, for\\neach of these scenarios. The relative ordering of the Rt=0 in the countries is consistent in all settings.\\nHowever, as expected, the scale of Rt=0 is considerably affected by this change — a longer serial\\ninterval results in a higher estimated Rt=0. This is because to reach the currently observed size of the\\nepidemics, a longer assumed serial interval is compensated by a higher estimated R0.\\n\\nAdditionally, in Figure 14, we show our estimates of Rt at the most recent model time point, again for\\neach ofthese scenarios. The serial interval mean can influence Rt substantially, however, the posterior\\ncredible intervals of Rt are broadly overlapping.\\n\\n\\nFigure 13: Initial reproduction number R0 for different serial interval (SI) distributions (means\\nbetween 5 and 8 days). We use 6.5 days in our main analysis.\\n\\n\\nFigure 14: Rt on 28 March 2020 estimated for all countries, with serial interval (SI) distribution means\\nbetween 5 and 8 days. We use 6.5 days in our main analysis.\\n\\n8.4.3 Uninformative prior sensitivity on or\\n\\nWe ran our model using implausible uninformative prior distributions on the intervention effects,\\nallowing the effect of an intervention to increase or decrease Rt. To avoid collinearity, we ran 6\\nseparate models, with effects summarized below (compare with the main analysis in Figure 4). In this\\nseries of univariate analyses, we find (Figure 15) that all effects on their own serve to decrease Rt.\\nThis gives us confidence that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in the\\nmain analysis. Lockdown has a very large effect, most likely due to the fact that it occurs after other\\ninterventions in our dataset. The relatively large effect sizes for the other interventions are most likely\\ndue to the coincidence of the interventions in time, such that one intervention is a proxy for a few\\nothers.\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: Effects of different interventions when used as the only covariate in the model.\\n\\n8.4.4\\n\\nTo assess prior assumptions on our piecewise constant functional form for Rt we test using a\\nnonparametric function with a Gaussian process prior distribution. We fit a model with a Gaussian\\nprocess prior distribution to data from Italy where there is the largest signal in death data. We find\\nthat the Gaussian process has a very similartrend to the piecewise constant model and reverts to the\\nmean in regions of no data. The correspondence of a completely nonparametric function and our\\npiecewise constant function suggests a suitable parametric specification of Rt.\\n\\nNonparametric fitting of Rf using a Gaussian process:\\n\\n8.4.5 Leave country out analysis\\n\\nDue to the different lengths of each European countries’ epidemic, some countries, such as Italy have\\nmuch more data than others (such as the UK). To ensure that we are not leveraging too much\\ninformation from any one country we perform a ”leave one country out” sensitivity analysis, where\\nwe rerun the model without a different country each time. Figure 16 and Figure 17 are examples for\\nresults for the UK, leaving out Italy and Spain. In general, for all countries, we observed no significant\\ndependence on any one country.\\n\\nFigure 16: Model results for the UK, when not using data from Italy for fitting the model. See the\\n\\n\\nFigure 17: Model results for the UK, when not using data from Spain for fitting the model. See caption\\nof Figure 2 for an explanation of the plots.\\n\\n8.4.6 Starting reproduction numbers vs theoretical predictions\\n\\nTo validate our starting reproduction numbers, we compare our fitted values to those theoretically\\nexpected from a simpler model assuming exponential growth rate, and a serial interval distribution\\nmean. We fit a linear model with a Poisson likelihood and log link function and extracting the daily\\ngrowth rate r. For well-known theoretical results from the renewal equation, given a serial interval\\ndistribution g(r) with mean m and standard deviation 5, given a = mZ/S2 and b = m/SZ, and\\n\\na\\nsubsequently R0 = (1 + %) .Figure 18 shows theoretically derived R0 along with our fitted\\n\\nestimates of Rt=0 from our Bayesian hierarchical model. As shown in Figure 18 there is large\\ncorrespondence between our estimated starting reproduction number and the basic reproduction\\nnumber implied by the growth rate r.\\n\\nR0 (red) vs R(FO) (black)\\n\\nFigure 18: Our estimated R0 (black) versus theoretically derived Ru(red) from a log-linear\\nregression fit.\\n\\n8.5 Counterfactual analysis — interventions vs no interventions\\n\\n\\nFigure 19: Daily number of confirmed deaths, predictions (up to 28 March) and forecasts (after) for\\nall countries except Italy and Spain from our model with interventions (blue) and from the no\\ninterventions counterfactual model (pink); credible intervals are shown one week into the future.\\n\\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.25561/77731\\n\\nPage 28 of 35\\n\\n30 March 2020 Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team\\n\\n8.6 Data sources and Timeline of Interventions\\n\\nFigure 1 and Table 3 display the interventions by the 11 countries in our study and the dates these\\ninterventions became effective.\\n\\nTable 3: Timeline of Interventions.\\n \\n\\nCountry Type Event Date effective\\nSchool closure\\nordered Nationwide school closures.20 14/3/2020\\nPublic events\\nbanned Banning of gatherings of more than 5 people.21 10/3/2020\\nBanning all access to public spaces and gatherings\\nLockdown of more than 5 people.

cov - z ) and its spread outside of china, europe is now experiencing large epidemics. in response, many european countries have implemented unprecedented non - pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and / or public events, and most recently, widescale social distancing including local and national iockdowns. in this report, we use a semi - mechanistic bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact of these interventions across 11 european countries. our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number — a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. one of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number across countries and over time. this allows us to leverage a greater amount of data across europe to estimate these effects. it also means that our results are driven strongly by the data from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as italy and spain. we find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in italy is consistent with a significant impact of interventions implemented several weeks earlier. in italy, we estimate that the effective reproduction number, rt, dropped to close to 1 around the time of iockdown ( 11th march ), although with a high level of uncertainty. overall, we estimate that countries have managed to reduce their reproduction number. our estimates have wide credible intervals and contain 1 for countries that have implemented a | | interventions considered in our analysis. this means that the reproduction number may be above or below this value. with current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of march, we estimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59, 000 deaths up to 31 march [ 95 % credible interval 21, 000 - 120, 000 ]. many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. we estimate that, across all 11 countries between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with sars - cov - z up to 28th march, representing between 1. 88 % and 11. 43 % ofthe population. the proportion of the population infected to date — the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in spain followed by italy and lowest in germany and norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics. given the lag of 2 - 3 weeks between when transmission changes occur and when their impact can be observed in trends in mortality, for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be certain that recent interventions have been effective. if interventions in countries at earlier stages of their epidemic, such as germany or the uk, are more or less effective than they were in the countries with advanced epidemics, on which our estimates are largely based, or if interventions have improved or worsened over time, then our estimates of the reproduction number and deaths averted would change accordingly. it is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in cases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that transmission of sars - cov - z is slowing. suggested citation seth flaxman, swapnil mishra, axel gandy et 0 /. estimating the number of infections and the impact of non — pharmaceutical interventions on covid — 19 in 11 european countries. imperial college london ( 2020 ), doi : https : / / doi. org / 10. 25561 / 77731 1 introduction following the emergence of a novel coronavirus ( sars - cov - z ) in wuhan, china in december 2019 and its global spread, large epidemics of the disease, caused by the virus designated covid - 19, have emerged in europe. in response to the rising numbers of cases and deaths, and to maintain the capacity of health systems to treat as many severe cases as possible, european countries, like those in other continents, have implemented or are in the process of implementing measures to control their epidemics. these large - scale non - pharmaceutical interventions vary between countries but include social distancing ( such as banning large gatherings and advising individuals not to socialize outside their households ), border closures, school closures, measures to isolate symptomatic individuals and their contacts, and large - scale lockdowns of populations with all but essential internal travel banned. understanding firstly, whether these interventions are having the desired impact of controlling the epidemic and secondly, which interventions are necessary to maintain control, is critical given their large economic and social costs. the key aim ofthese interventions is to reduce the effective reproduction number, rt, ofthe infection, a fundamental epidemiological quantity representing the average number of infections, at time t, per infected case over the course of their infection. ith is maintained at less than 1, the incidence of new infections decreases, ultimately resulting in control of the epidemic. if rt is greater than 1, then infections will increase ( dependent on how much greater than 1 the reproduction number is ) until the epidemic peaks and eventually declines due to acquisition of herd immunity. in china, strict movement restrictions and other measures including case isolation and quarantine began to be introduced from 23rd january, which achieved a downward trend in the number of confirmed new cases during february, resulting in zero new confirmed indigenous cases in wuhan by march 19th. studies have estimated how rt changed during this time in different areas ofchina from around 2 - 4 during the uncontrolled epidemic down to below 1, with an estimated 7 - 9 fold decrease in the number of daily contacts per person. 1\\'2 control measures such as social distancing, intensive testing, and contact tracing in other countries such as singapore and south korea have successfully reduced case incidence in recent weeks, although there is a riskthe virus will spread again once control measures are relaxed. 3\\'4 the epidemic began slightly laterin europe, from january or later in different regions. 5 countries have implemented different combinations of control measures and the level of adherence to government recommendations on social distancing is likely to vary between countries, in part due to different levels of enforcement. estimating reproduction numbers for sars - cov - z presents challenges due to the high proportion of infections not detected by health systems ” 7 and regular changes in testing policies, resulting in different proportions of infections being detected over time and between countries. most countries so far only have the capacity to test a small proportion of suspected cases and tests are reserved for severely ill patients or for high - risk groups ( e. g. contacts of cases ). looking at case data, therefore, gives a systematically biased view of trends. an alternative way to estimate the course of the epidemic is to back - calculate infections from observed deaths. reported deaths are likely to be more reliable, although the early focus of most surveillance systems on cases with reported travel histories to china may mean that some early deaths will have been missed. whilst the recent trends in deaths will therefore be informative, there is a time lag in observing the effect of interventions on deaths since there is a 2 - 3 - week period between infection, onset of symptoms and outcome. in this report, we fit a novel bayesian mechanistic model of the infection cycle to observed deaths in 11 european countries, inferring plausible upper and lower bounds ( bayesian credible intervals ) of the total populations infected ( attack rates ), case detection probabilities, and the reproduction number over time ( rt ). we fit the model jointly to covid - 19 data from all these countries to assess whether there is evidence that interventions have so far been successful at reducing rt below 1, with the strong assumption that particular interventions are achieving a similar impact in different countries and that the efficacy of those interventions remains constant over time. the model is informed more strongly by countries with larger numbers of deaths and which implemented interventions earlier, therefore estimates of recent rt in countries with more recent interventions are contingent on similar intervention impacts. data in the coming weeks will enable estimation of country - specific rt with greater precision. model and data details are presented in the appendix, validation and sensitivity are also presented in the appendix, and general limitations presented below in the conclusions. 2 results the timing of interventions should be taken in the context of when an individual country ’ s epidemic started to grow along with the speed with which control measures were implemented. italy was the first to begin intervention measures, and other countries followed soon afterwards ( figure 1 ). most interventions began around 12th - 14th march. we analyzed data on deaths up to 28th march, giving a 2 - 3 - week window over which to estimate the effect of interventions. currently, most countries in our study have implemented all major non - pharmaceutical interventions. for each country, we model the number of infections, the number of deaths, and rt, the effective reproduction number over time, with rt changing only when an intervention is introduced ( figure 2 - 12 ). rt is the average number of secondary infections per infected individual, assuming that the interventions that are in place at time t stay in place throughout their entire infectious period. every country has its own individual starting reproduction number rt before interventions take place. specific interventions are assumed to have the same relative impact on rt in each country when they were introduced there and are informed by mortality data across all countries. figure l : intervention timings for the 11 european countries included in the analysis. for further details see appendix 8. 6. 2. 1 estimated true numbers of infections and current attack rates in all countries, we estimate there are orders of magnitude fewer infections detected ( figure 2 ) than true infections, mostly likely due to mild and asymptomatic infections as well as limited testing capacity. in italy, our results suggest that, cumulatively, 5. 9 [ 1. 9 - 15. 2 ] million people have been infected as of march 28th, giving an attack rate of 9. 8 % [ 3. 2 % - 25 % ] of the population ( table 1 ). spain has recently seen a large increase in the number of deaths, and given its smaller population, our model estimates that a higher proportion of the population, 15. 0 % ( 7. 0 [ 18 - 19 ] million people ) have been infected to date. germany is estimated to have one of the lowest attack rates at 0. 7 % with 600, 000 [ 240, 000 - 1, 500, 000 ] people infected. imperial college covid - 19 response team table l : posterior model estimates of percentage of total population infected as of 28th march 2020. country % of total population infected ( mean [ 95 % credible intervall ) austria 1. 1 % [ 0. 36 % -

4. 66 ], which is in line with other estimates. 1\\'8 these estimates are informed by our choice of serial interval distribution and the initial growth rate of observed deaths. a shorter assumed serial interval results in lower starting reproduction numbers ( appendix 8. 4. 2, appendix 8. 4. 6 ). the initial reproduction numbers are also uncertain due to ( a ) importation being the dominant source of new infections early in the epidemic, rather than local transmission ( b ) possible under - ascertainment in deaths particularly before testing became widespread. we estimate large changes in rt in response to the combined non - pharmaceutical interventions. our results, which are driven largely by countries with advanced epidemics and larger numbers of deaths ( e. g. italy, spain ), suggest that these interventions have together had a substantial impact on transmission, as measured by changes in the estimated reproduction number rt. across all countries we find current estimates of rt to range from a posterior mean of 0. 97 [ 0. 14 - 2. 14 ] for norway to a posterior mean of2. 64 [ 1. 40 - 4. 18 ] for sweden, with an average of 1. 43 across the 11 country posterior means, a 64 % reduction compared to the pre - intervention values. we note that these estimates are contingent on intervention impact being the same in different countries and at different times. in all countries but sweden, under the same assumptions, we estimate that the current reproduction number includes 1 in the uncertainty range. the estimated reproduction number for sweden is higher, not because the mortality trends are significantly different from any other country, but as an artefact of our model, which assumes a smaller reduction in rt because no full lockdown has been ordered so far. overall, we cannot yet conclude whether current interventions are sufficient to drive rt below 1 ( posterior probability of being less than 1. 0 is 44 % on average across the countries ). we are also unable to conclude whether interventions may be different between countries or over time. there remains a high level of uncertainty in these estimates. it is too early to detect substantial intervention impact in many countries at earlier stages of their epidemic ( e. g. germany, uk, norway ). many interventions have occurred only recently, and their effects have not yet been fully observed due to the time lag between infection and death. this uncertainty will reduce as more data become available. for all countries, our model fits observed deaths data well ( bayesian goodness of fit tests ). we also found that our model can reliably forecast daily deaths 3 days into the future, by withholding the latest 3 days of data and comparing model predictions to observed deaths ( appendix 8. 3 ). the close spacing of interventions in time made it statistically impossible to determine which had the greatest effect ( figure 1, figure 4 ). however, when doing a sensitivity analysis ( appendix 8. 4. 3 ) with uninformative prior distributions ( where interventions can increase deaths ) we find similar impact of imperial college covid - 19 response team interventions, which shows that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in the main analysis. figure 2 : country - level estimates of infections, deaths and rt. left : daily number of infections, brown bars are reported infections, blue bands are predicted infections, dark blue 50 % credible interval ( ci ), light blue 95 % ci. the number of daily infections estimated by our model drops immediately after an intervention, as we assume that all infected people become immediately less infectious through the intervention. afterwards, if the rt is above 1, the number of infections will starts growing again. middle : daily number of deaths, brown bars are reported deaths, blue bands are predicted deaths, ci as in left plot. right : time -

one - out cross - validation and the widely applicable information criterion assessments — wa | c ). by comparing the deaths predicted under the model with no interventions to the deaths predicted in our intervention model, we calculated the total deaths averted up to the end of march. we find that, across 11 countries, since the beginning of the epidemic, 59, 000 [ 21, 000 - 120, 000 ] deaths have been averted due to interventions. in italy and spain, where the epidemic is advanced, 38, 000 [ 13, 000 - 84, 000 ] and 16, 000 [ 5, 400 - 35, 000 ] deaths have been averted, respectively. even in the uk, which is much earlier in its epidemic, we predict 370 [ 73 - 1, 000 ] deaths have been averted. these numbers give only the deaths averted that would have occurred up to 31 march. lfwe were to include the deaths of currently infected individuals in both models, which might happen after 31 march, then the deaths averted would be substantially higher. figure 3 : daily number of confirmed deaths, predictions ( up to 28 march ) and forecasts ( after ) for ( a ) italy and ( b ) spain from our model with interventions ( blue ) and from the no interventions counterfactual model ( pink ) ; credible intervals are shown one week into the future. other countries are shown in appendix 8. 6. 03 / 0 25 % 50 % 753 % 100 % ( no effect on transmissibility ) ( ends transmissibility relative % reduction in r. figure 4 : our model includes five covariates for governmental interventions, adjusting for whether the intervention was the first one undertaken by the government in response to covid - 19 ( red ) or was subsequent to other interventions ( green ). mean relative percentage reduction in rt is shown with 95 % posterior credible intervals. if 100 % reduction is achieved, rt = 0 and there is no more transmission of covid - 19. no effects are significantly different from any others, probably due to the fact that many interventions occurred on the same day or within days of each other as shown in figure l. 3 discussion during this early phase of control measures against the novel coronavirus in europe, we analyze trends in numbers of deaths to assess the extent to which transmission is being reduced. representing the covld - 19 infection process using a semi - mechanistic, joint, bayesian hierarchical model, we can reproduce trends observed in the data on deaths and can forecast accurately over short time horizons. we estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. the high level of under - ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in hospital settings rather than in the community. despite this, only a small minority of individuals in each country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 4. 9 % [ l. 9 % - ll % ] with considerable variation between countries ( table 1 ). our estimates imply that the populations in europe are not close to herd immunity ( \" 50 - 75 % if r0 is 2 - 4 ). further, with rt values dropping substantially, the rate of acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. this implies that the virus will be able to spread rapidly should interventions be lifted. such estimates of the attack rate to date urgently need to be validated by newly developed antibody tests in representative population surveys, once these become available. we estimate that major non - pharmaceutical interventions have had a substantial impact on the time - varying reproduction numbers in countries where there has been time to observe intervention effects on trends in deaths ( italy, spain ). lfadherence in those countries has changed since that initial period, then our forecast of future deaths will be affected accordingly : increasing adherence over time will have resulted in fewer deaths and decreasing adherence in more deaths. similarly, our estimates of the impact ofinterventions in other countries should be viewed with caution if the same interventions have achieved different levels of adherence than was initially the case in italy and spain. due to the implementation of interventions in rapid succession in many countries, there are not enough data to estimate the individual effect size of each intervention, and we discourage attributing associations to individual intervention. in some cases, such as norway, where all interventions were implemented at once, these individual effects are by definition unidentifiable. despite this, while individual impacts cannot be determined, their estimated joint impact is strongly empirically justified ( see appendix 8. 4 for sensitivity analysis ). while the growth in daily deaths has decreased, due to the lag between infections and deaths, continued rises in daily deaths are to be expected for some time. to understand the impact of interventions, we fit a counterfactual model without the interventions and compare this to the actual model. consider italy and the uk - two countries at very different stages in their epidemics. for the uk, where interventions are very recent, much of the intervention strength is borrowed from countries with older epidemics. the results suggest that interventions will have a large impact on infections and deaths despite counts of both rising. for italy, where far more time has passed since the interventions have been implemented, it is clear that the model without interventions does not fit well to the data, and cannot explain the sub - linear ( on the logarithmic scale ) reduction in deaths ( see figure 10 ). the counterfactual model for italy suggests that despite mounting pressure on health systems, interventions have averted a health care catastrophe where the number of new deaths would have been 3. 7 times higher ( 38, 000 deaths averted ) than currently observed. even in the uk, much earlier in its epidemic, the recent interventions are forecasted to avert 370 total deaths up to 31 of march. 4 conclusion and limitations modern understanding of infectious disease with a global publicized response has meant that nationwide interventions could be implemented with widespread adherence and support. given observed infection fatality ratios and the epidemiology of covld - 19, major non - pharmaceutical interventions have had a substantial impact in reducing transmission in countries with more advanced epidemics. it is too early to be sure whether similar reductions will be seen in countries at earlier stages of their epidemic. while we cannot determine which set of interventions have been most successful, taken together, we can already see changes in the trends of new deaths. when forecasting 3 days and looking over the whole epidemic the number of deaths averted is substantial. we note that substantial innovation is taking place, and new more effective interventions or refinements of current interventions, alongside behavioral changes will further contribute to reductions in infections. we cannot say for certain that the current measures have controlled the epidemic in europe ; however, if current trends continue, there is reason for optimism. our approach is semi - mechanistic. we propose a plausible structure for the infection process and then estimate parameters empirically. however, many parameters had to be given strong prior distributions or had to be fixed. for these assumptions, we have provided relevant citations to previous studies. as more data become available and better estimates arise, we will update these in weekly reports. our choice of serial interval distribution strongly influences the prior distribution for starting r0. our infection fatality ratio, and infection - to - onset - to - death distributions strongly influence the rate of death and hence the estimated number of true underlying cases. we also assume that the effect of interventions is the same in all countries, which may not be fully realistic. this assumption implies that countries with early interventions and more deaths since these interventions ( e. g. italy, spain ) strongly influence estimates of intervention impact in countries at earlier stages of their epidemic with fewer deaths ( e. g. germany, uk ). we have tried to create consistent definitions of all interventions and document details of this in appendix 8. 6. however, invariably there will be differences from country to country in the strength of their intervention — for example, most countries have banned gatherings of more than 2 people when implementing a lockdown, whereas in sweden the government only banned gatherings of more than 10 people. these differences can skew impacts in countries with very little data. we believe that our uncertainty to some degree can cover these differences, and as more data become available, coefficients should become more reliable. however, despite these strong assumptions, there is sufficient signal in the data to estimate changes in r, ( see the sensitivity analysis reported in appendix 8. 4. 3 ) and this signal will stand to increase with time. in our bayesian hierarchical framework, we robustly quantify the uncertainty in our parameter estimates and posterior predictions. this can be seen in the very wide credible intervals in more recent days, where little or no death data are available to inform the estimates. furthermore, we predict intervention impact at country - level, but different trends may be in place in different parts of each country. for example, the epidemic in northern italy was subject to controls earlier than the rest of the country. 5 data our model utilizes daily real - time death data from the ecdc ( european centre of disease control ), where we catalogue case data for 11 european countries currently experiencing the epidemic : austria, belgium, denmark, france, germany, italy, norway, spain, sweden, switzerland and the united kingdom. the ecdc provides information on confirmed cases and deaths attributable to covid - 19. however, the case data are highly unrepresentative of the incidence of infections due to underreporting as well as systematic and country - specific changes in testing. we, therefore, use only deaths attributable to covid - 19 in our model ; we do not use the ecdc case estimates at all. while the observed deaths still have some degree of unreliability, again due to changes in reporting and testing, we believe the data are ofsufficient fidelity to model. for population counts, we use unpop age - stratified counts. 10 we also catalogue data on the nature and type of major non - pharmaceutical interventions. we looked at the government webpages from each country as well as their official public health division / information webpages to identify the latest advice / laws being issued by the government and public health authorities. we collected the following : school closure ordered : this intervention refers to nationwide extraordinary school closures which in most cases refer to both primary and secondary schools closing ( for most countries this also includes the closure of otherforms of higher education or the advice to teach remotely ). in the case of denmark and sweden, we allowed partial school closures of only secondary schools. the date of the school closure is taken to be the effective date when the schools started to be closed ( ifthis was on a monday, the date used was the one of the previous saturdays as pupils and students effectively stayed at home from that date onwards ). case - based measures : this intervention comprises strong recommendations or laws to the general public and primary care about self — isolation when showing covid - 19 - like symptoms. these also include nationwide testing programs where individuals can be tested and subsequently self — isolated. our definition is restricted to nationwide government advice to all individuals ( e. g. uk ) or to all primary care and excludes regional only advice. these do not include containment phase interventions such as isolation if travelling back from an epidemic country such as china. public events banned : this refers to banning all public events of more than 100 participants such as sports events. social distancing encouraged : as one of the first interventions against the spread of the covid - 19 pandemic, many governments have published advice on social distancing including the recommendation to work from home wherever possible, reducing use ofpublictransport and all other non - essential contact. the dates used are those when social distancing has officially been recommended by the government ; the advice may include maintaining a recommended physical distance from others. lockdown decreed : there are several different scenarios that the media refers to as lockdown. as an overall definition, we consider regulations / legislations regarding strict face - to - face social interaction : including the banning of any non - essential public gatherings, closure of educational and public / cultural institutions, ordering people to stay home apart from exercise and essential tasks. we include special cases where these are not explicitly mentioned on government websites but are enforced by the police ( e. g. france ). the dates used are the effective dates when these legislations have been implemented. we note that lockdown encompasses other interventions previously implemented. first intervention : as figure 1 shows, european governments have escalated interventions rapidly, and in some examples ( norway / denmark ) have implemented these interventions all on a single day. therefore, given the temporal autocorrelation inherent in government intervention, we include a binary covariate for the first intervention, which can be interpreted as a government decision to take major action to control covid - 19. a full list of the timing of these interventions and the sources we have used can be found in appendix 8. 6. 6 methods summary a visual summary of our model is presented in figure 5 ( details in appendix 8. 1 and 8. 2 ). replication code is available at https : / / github. com / | mperia | collegelondon / covid19model / releases / tag / vl. 0 we fit our model to observed deaths according to ecdc data from 11 european countries. the modelled deaths are informed by an infection - to - onset distribution ( time from infection to the onset of symptoms ), an onset - to - death distribution ( time from the onset of symptoms to death ), and the population - averaged infection fatality ratio ( adjusted for the age structure and contact patterns of each country, see appendix ). given these distributions and ratios, modelled deaths are a function of the number of infections. the modelled number of infections is informed by the serial interval distribution ( the average time from infection of one person to the time at which they infect another ) and the time - varying reproduction number. finally, the time - varying reproduction number is a function of the initial reproduction number before interventions and the effect sizes from interventions. figure 5 : summary of model components. following the hierarchy from bottom to top gives us a full framework to see how interventions affect infections, which can result in deaths. we use bayesian inference to ensure our modelled deaths can reproduce the observed deaths as closely as possible. from bottom to top in figure 5, there is an implicit lag in time that means the effect of very recent interventions manifest weakly in current deaths ( and get stronger as time progresses ). to maximise the ability to observe intervention impact on deaths, we fit our model jointly for all 11 european countries, which results in a large data set. our model jointly estimates the effect sizes of interventions. we have evaluated the effect ofour bayesian prior distribution choices and evaluate our bayesian posterior calibration to ensure our results are statistically robust ( appendix 8. 4 ). 7 acknowledgements initial research on covariates in appendix 8. 6 was crowdsourced ; we thank a number of people across the world for help with this. this work was supported by centre funding from the uk medical research council under a concordat with the uk department for international development, the nihr health protection research unit in modelling methodology and communityjameel. 8 appendix : model specifics, validation and sensitivity analysis 8. 1 death model we observe daily deaths dam for days t e 1,..., n and countries m e 1,..., p. these daily deaths are modelled using a positive real - valued function dam = e ( dam ) that represents the expected number of deaths attributed to covid - 19. dam is assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution with the expected number of deaths ( 1 in a given country on a given day is a function of the number of infections c occurring in previous days. at the beginning of the epidemic, the observed deaths in a country can be dominated by deaths that result from infection that are not locally acquired. to avoid biasing our model by this, we only include observed deaths from the day after a country has cumulatively observed 10 deaths in our model. to mechanistically link ourfunction for deaths to infected cases, we use a previously estimated covid - 19 infection - fatality - ratio ifr ( probability of death given infection ) 9 together with a distribution oftimes from infection to death te. the ifr is derived from estimates presented in verity et al11 which assumed homogeneous attack rates across age - groups. to better match estimates of attack rates by age generated using more detailed information on country and age - specific mixing patterns, we scale these estimates ( the unadjusted ifr, referred to here as ifr ’ ) in the following way as in previous work. 4 let ca be the number of infections generated in age - group a, na the underlying size of the population in that age group and ar “ 2 ca / na the age - group - specific attack rate. the adjusted ifr is then given by : ifra = ﬁfiﬁe, where ar50 _ 59 is the predicted attack - rate in the 50 - 59 year age - group after incorporating country - specific patterns of contact and mixing. this age - group was chosen as the reference as it had the lowest predicted level of underreporting in previous analyses of data from the chinese epidemic “. we obtained country - specific estimates of attack rate by age, ar “, for the 11 european countries in our analysis from a previous study which incorporates information on contact between individuals of different ages in countries across europe. 12 we then obtained overall ifr estimates for each country adjusting for both demography and age - specific attack rates. using estimated epidemiological information from previous studies, “\\'11 we assume te to be the sum of two independent random times : the incubation period ( infection to onset of symptoms or infection - to - onset ) distribution and the time between onset of symptoms and death ( onset - to - death ). the infection - to - onset distribution is gamma distributed with mean 5. 1 days and coefficient of variation 0. 86. the onset - to - death distribution is also gamma distributed with a mean of 18. 8 days and a coefficient of va riation 0. 45. ifrm is population averaged over the age structure of a given country. the infection - to - death distribution is therefore given by : um ~ ifrm ~ ( gamma ( 5. 1, 0. 86 ) + gamma ( 18. 8, 0. 45 ) ) figure 6 shows the infection - to - death distribution and the resulting survival function that integrates to the infection fatality ratio. figure 6 : left, infection - to - death distribution ( mean 23. 9 days ). right, survival probability of infected individuals per day given the infection fatality ratio ( 1 % ) and the infection - to - death distribution on the left. using the probability of death distribution, the expected number of deaths dam, on a given day t, for country, m, is given by the following discrete sum : the number of deaths today is the sum of the past infections weighted by their probability of death, where the probability of death depends on the number of days since infection. 8. 2 infection model the true number of infected individuals, c, is modelled using a discrete renewal process. this approach has been used in numerous previous studies13\\'16 and has a strong theoretical basis in stochastic individual - based counting processes such as hawkes process and the bellman - harris process. ” 18 the renewal model is related to the susceptible - infected - recovered model, except the renewal is not expressed in differential form. to model the number ofinfections over time we need to specify a serial interval distribution g with density g ( t ), ( the time between when a person gets infected and when they subsequently infect another other people ), which we choose to be gamma distributed : g ~ gamma ( 6. 50. 62 ). the serial interval distribution is shown below in figure 7 and is assumed to be the same for all countries. figure 7 : serial interval distribution g with a mean of 6. 5 days. given the serial interval distribution, the number of infections eamon a given day t, and country, m, is given by the following discrete convolution function : _ t — 1 cam — ram zt = 0 cr, mgt — ‘ r r where, similarto the probability ofdeath function, the daily serial interval is discretized by fs + 0. 5 1. 5 gs = t = s — 0. sg ( t ) dt fors = 2, 3, and 91 = ft = og ( t ) dt. infections today depend on the number of infections in the previous days, weighted by the discretized serial interval distribution. this weighting is then scaled by the country - specific time - varying reproduction number, ram, that models the average number of secondary infections at a given time. the functional form for the time - varying reproduction number was chosen to be as simple as possible to minimize the impact of strong prior assumptions : we use a piecewise constant function that scales ram from a baseline prior r0, m and is driven by known major non - pharmaceutical interventions occurring in different countries and times. we included 6 interventions, one of which is constructed from the other 5 interventions, which are timings of school and university closures ( k = l ), self — isolating if ill ( k = 2 ), banning of public events ( k = 3 ), any government intervention in place ( k = 4 ), implementing a partial or complete lockdown ( k = 5 ) and encouraging social distancing and isolation ( k = 6 ). we denote the indicator variable for intervention k e 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by iki ’ m, which is 1 if intervention k is in place in country m at time t and 0 otherwise. the covariate ” any government intervention ” ( k = 4 ) indicates if any of the other 5 interventions are in effect, i. e. 14 ’ t ’ m equals 1 at time t if any of the interventions k e 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are in effect in country m at time t and equals 0 otherwise. covariate 4 has the interpretation of indicating the onset of major government intervention. the effect of each intervention is assumed to be multiplicative. ram is therefore a function ofthe intervention indicators ik ’ t ’ m in place at time t in country m : ram : r0, m exp ( — 212 : 1 o ( rheum ) - the exponential form was used to ensure positivity of the reproduction number, with r0, m constrained to be positive as it appears outside the exponential. the impact of each intervention on ram is characterised by a set of parameters 0 ( 1,..., ol6, with independent prior distributions chosen to be ock ~ gamma (. 5, 1 ). the impacts ock are shared between all m countries and therefore they are informed by all available data. the prior distribution for r0 was chosen to be r0, m ~ normal ( 2. 4, iki ) with k ~ normal ( 0, 0. 5 ), once again, k is the same among all countries to share information. we assume that seeding of new infections begins 30 days before the day after a country has cumulatively observed 10 deaths. from this date, we seed our model with 6 sequential days of infections drawn from cl ’ m,..., 66 ’ m ~ exponential ( t ), where t ~ exponential ( 0. 03 ). these seed infections are inferred in our bayesian posterior distribution. we estimated parameters jointly for all 11 countries in a single hierarchical model. fitting was done in the probabilistic programming language stan, 19 using an adaptive hamiltonian monte carlo ( hmc ) sampler. we ran 8 chains for 4000 iterations with 2000 iterations of warmup and a thinning factor 4 to obtain 2000 posterior samples. posterior convergence was assessed using the rhat statistic and by diagnosing divergent transitions of the hmc sampler. prior - posterior calibrations were also performed ( see below ). 8. 3 validation we validate accuracy of point estimates of our model using cross - validation. in our cross - validation scheme, we leave out 3 days of known death data ( non - cumulative ) and fit our model. we forecast what the model predicts for these three days. we present the individual forecasts for each day, as well as the average forecast for those three days. the cross - validation results are shown in the figure 8. figure 8 : cross - validation results for 3 - day and 3 - day aggregatedforecasts figure 8 provides strong empirical justification for our model specification and mechanism. our accurate forecast over a three - day time horizon suggests that our fitted estimates for rt are appropriate and plausible. along with from point estimates we all evaluate our posterior credible intervals using the rhat statistic. the rhat statistic measures whether our markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) chains have converged to the equilibrium distribution ( the correct posterior distribution ). figure 9 shows the rhat statistics for all of our parameters figure 9 : rhat statistics - values close to 1 indicate mcmc convergence. figure 9 indicates that our mcmc have converged. in fitting we also ensured that the mcmc sampler experienced no divergent transitions - suggesting non pathological posterior topologies. 8. 4 sensitivityanalysis 8. 4. 1 forecasting on log - linear scale to assess signal in the data as we have highlighted throughout in this report, the lag between deaths and infections means that it ta kes time for information to propagate backwa rds from deaths to infections, and ultimately to rt. a conclusion of this report is the prediction of a slowing of rt in response to major interventions. to gain intuition that this is data driven and not simply a consequence of highly constrained model assumptions, we show death forecasts on a log - linear scale. on this scale a line which curves below a linear trend is indicative of slowing in the growth of the epidemic. figure 10 to figure 12 show these forecasts for italy, spain and the uk. they show this slowing down in the daily number of deaths. our model suggests that italy, a country that has the highest death toll of covid - 19, will see a slowing in the increase in daily deaths over the coming week compared to the early stages of the epidemic. we investigated the sensitivity of our estimates of starting and final rt to our assumed serial interval distribution. for this we considered several scenarios, in which we changed the serial interval distribution mean, from a value of 6. 5 days, to have values of 5, 6, 7 and 8 days. in figure 13, we show our estimates of r0, the starting reproduction number before interventions, for each of these scenarios. the relative ordering of the rt = 0 in the countries is consistent in all settings. however, as expected, the scale of rt = 0 is considerably affected by this change — a longer serial interval results in a higher estimated rt = 0. this is because to reach the currently observed size of the epidemics, a longer assumed serial interval is compensated by a higher estimated r0. additionally, in figure 14, we show our estimates of rt at the most recent model time point, again for each ofthese scenarios. the serial interval mean can influence rt substantially, however, the posterior credible intervals of rt are broadly overlapping. figure 13 : initial reproduction number r0 for different serial interval ( si ) distributions ( means between 5 and 8 days ). we use 6. 5 days in our main analysis. figure 14 : rt on 28 march 2020 estimated for all countries, with serial interval ( si ) distribution means between 5 and 8 days. we use 6. 5 days in our main analysis. 8. 4. 3 uninformative prior sensitivity on or we ran our model using implausible uninformative prior distributions on the intervention effects, allowing the effect of an intervention to increase or decrease rt. to avoid collinearity, we ran 6 separate models, with effects summarized below ( compare with the main analysis in figure 4 ). in this series of univariate analyses, we find ( figure 15 ) that all effects on their own serve to decrease rt. this gives us confidence that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in the main analysis. lockdown has a very large effect, most likely due to the fact that it occurs after other interventions in our dataset. the relatively large effect sizes for the other interventions are most likely due to the coincidence of the interventions in time, such that one intervention is a proxy for a few others. figure 15 : effects of different interventions when used as the only covariate in the model. 8. 4. 4 to assess prior assumptions on our piecewise constant functional form for rt we test using a nonparametric function with a gaussian process prior distribution. we fit a model with a gaussian process prior distribution to data from italy where there is the largest signal in death data. we find that the gaussian process has a very similartrend to the piecewise constant model and reverts to the mean in regions of no data. the correspondence of a completely nonparametric function and our piecewise constant function suggests a suitable parametric specification of rt. nonparametric fitting of rf using a gaussian process : 8. 4. 5 leave country out analysis due to the different lengths of each european countries ’ epidemic, some countries, such as italy have much more data than others ( such as the uk ). to ensure that we are not leveraging too much information from any one country we perform a ” leave one country out ” sensitivity analysis, where we rerun the model without a different country each time. figure 16 and figure 17 are examples for results for the uk, leaving out italy and spain. in general, for all countries, we observed no significant dependence on any one country. figure 16 : model results for the uk, when not using data from italy for fitting the model. see the figure 17 : model results for the uk, when not using data from spain for fitting the model. see caption of figure 2 for an explanation of the plots. 8. 4. 6 starting reproduction numbers vs theoretical predictions to validate our starting reproduction numbers, we compare our fitted values to those theoretically expected from a simpler model assuming exponential growth rate, and a serial interval distribution mean. we fit a linear model with a poisson likelihood and log link function and extracting the daily growth rate r. for well - known theoretical results from the renewal equation, given a serial interval distribution g ( r ) with mean m and standard deviation 5, given a = mz / s2 and b = m / sz, and a subsequently r0 = ( 1 + % ). figure 18 shows theoretically derived r0 along with our fitted estimates of rt = 0 from our bayesian hierarchical model. as shown in figure 18 there is large correspondence between our estimated starting reproduction number and the basic reproduction number implied by the growth rate r. r0 ( red ) vs r ( fo ) ( black ) figure 18 : our estimated r0 ( black ) versus theoretically derived ru ( red ) from a log - linear regression fit. 8. 5 counterfactual analysis — interventions vs no interventions figure 19 : daily number of confirmed deaths, predictions ( up to 28 march ) and forecasts ( after ) for all countries except italy and spain from our model with interventions ( blue ) and from the no interventions counterfactual model ( pink ) ; credible intervals are shown one week into the future. doi : https : / / doi. org / 10. 25561 / 77731 page 28 of 35 30 march 2020 imperial college covid -
